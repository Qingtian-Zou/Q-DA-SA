# Thinking

Okay, let's try to figure out this chicken coop mystery. So, there are four suspects: A, B, C, and D. Only one of them is telling the truth, and the rest are lying. We need to determine who actually did it.

Let me list out each person's statement again:

- A says: "It's B who's to blame!"
- B says: "C's the culprit. No doubt about it."
- C says: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..."
- D says: "It's B...or C. One of the two!"

Hmm, okay. So each statement has to be evaluated based on who is telling the truth (only one) and who's lying.

First thought: Maybe we can assume each person is the culprit and check if only their statement would be true while others are lying. That might work.

Let me try that approach.

Case 1: Suppose A is the culprit.

If A did it, then let's see what each person says:

- A says "B" – but since A is guilty, this statement is a lie.
- B says "C" – lie because C is innocent here.
- C says "It's either A or B" – Wait, if A is guilty, then C's statement would be true? Because it's A. But wait, the problem states only one person is telling the truth. If A is guilty, then C's statement is partially correct (A is guilty), but does that count as a lie?

Wait, hold on. The wording here might be tricky. Let me parse C's statement again: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." So C is saying two things? Or is it a single statement where they're saying it's one of them and not sure which.

Hmm, the problem says only one person is telling the truth. So if someone makes a compound statement, we need to check if their entire statement is true or false.

In logic puzzles like this, usually a statement that says "X or Y" would be considered true if either X or Y is guilty (but not both). But in this case, since only one person did it, the culprit is exactly one of them.

Wait, but according to the problem: "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So we need to see for each scenario whether exactly one statement holds up as true.

Let me try again with Case 1: A is guilty.

A's statement: "It's B" → lie (since it's A)
B's statement: "C" → lie
C's statement: "Either A or B" → since A is guilty, this would be true. Wait, but C says "I'm not sure which..." Hmm, the "not sure which" part might imply that they don't know, so perhaps their entire statement is considered a lie? Or does it mean that they're saying the culprit is one of them but unsure?

This is a bit ambiguous. Let's think.

In logic puzzles, usually if someone says "It's X or Y", and only one is guilty, then depending on who is guilty, their statement could be true or false.

But here, C says: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." So the structure is that they are saying two things? Or it's a single assertion that it's one of them, with uncertainty.

Hmm. Maybe in this context, since only one person is guilty, if C is asserting that the culprit is A or B (so one of two), then if it actually is A or B, then C's statement would be true. But since they say "I'm not sure which", maybe their whole statement is considered truthful as a matter of fact? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps the key here is that only one person is telling the truth. So regardless of how the statements are parsed, we need to see for each case whether exactly one statement is true.

Let me try to formalize:

For each suspect (A, B, C, D), assume they're guilty, then check how many statements would be true.

Case 1: A is guilty.

- A says "B" → lie
- B says "C" → lie
- C says "A or B" → since A is guilty, this statement is true (because it's either A or B)
- D says "B or C" → since culprit is A, this statement is false

So here, only C would be telling the truth. That would mean that in this case, there's one truth-teller: C. But according to the problem, only one person is telling the truth. So this scenario (A guilty) leads to exactly one truth-teller (C), so this could be a possible solution.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, if A is guilty, then C's statement "It's either A or B" would be true because it is A, which is in the set. But C says "I'm not sure which...", which might imply that they are unsure of who exactly, but the fact that it's either A or B could still be considered a true statement? Hmm.

Wait, maybe this depends on interpretation. Let me see.

In some logic puzzles, if someone says "It's one of X or Y", then the statement is considered true if it is indeed one of them (regardless of which). So if C says "It's either A or B", and in reality it's A, then that statement would be true. The part about "I'm not sure which" might just be their uncertainty, but the factual claim here is that the culprit is one of those two.

So in this case, yes, C would be telling the truth if it's A or B.

Similarly, D says "It's B or C". If culprit is A, then this statement is false.

So in Case 1 (A guilty): only C is truthful. So that would mean only one truth-teller (C). But according to problem, exactly one person is telling the truth. So this scenario seems possible. Hmm.

But wait, we need to check all cases.

Case 2: B is guilty.

Check each statement:

- A says "B" → true
- B says "C" → lie
- C says "A or B" → since it's B, so statement is true
- D says "B or C" → since it's B, this statement is true

Wait, that's three truths. But problem states only one truth-teller. So this case invalid.

Case 3: C is guilty.

Check statements:

- A says "B" → lie
- B says "C" → true
- C says "A or B" → lie (since culprit is C)
- D says "B or C" → true

So here, two truths: B and D. Not allowed.

Case 4: D is guilty.

Check statements:

- A says "B" → lie
- B says "C" → lie
- C says "A or B" → lie (culprit is D)
- D says "B or C" → lie

Wait, all four are lying? But problem states only one is telling the truth. So this case would have zero truths, which contradicts.

Hmm, so according to this analysis:

Case 1: A guilty → 1 truth-teller (C)

Case 2: B guilty → 3 truths (A, C, D)

Case 3: C guilty → 2 truths (B, D)

Case 4: D guilty → 0 truths

So only Case 1 gives exactly one truth-teller. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's said that "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So according to this analysis, A would be the culprit.

But wait, hold on. Let me check again because sometimes these puzzles have tricks.

Wait, in Case 1: If A is guilty, then C says "It's either A or B". Since it is A, so that statement is true. But C also adds "I'm not sure which..." Does that affect anything?

Hmm. The problem states each person is making a statement. So if the entire statement is considered as a whole: C says two things: "It's either A or B" and "I'm not sure which...". In logic terms, if the first part is true (it's one of them), but they are unsure, does that make their whole statement a lie? Or is the truthfulness based on the factual claim?

This is a bit ambiguous. For example, in some puzzles, saying "I don't know" can be considered a true statement if you truly don't know, but here C says "It's either A or B... I'm not sure which". So maybe they are asserting that it's one of them (so the statement is true) and adding that they aren't sure. Hmm.

But in terms of truthfulness: If the culprit is indeed A or B, then C's statement that it's either A or B would be a true statement. The part "I'm not sure which" might not affect the truth value of the factual claim. So perhaps we only care about the factual assertion and ignore the uncertainty as a separate point.

Given that, in Case 1: If culprit is A, C's statement "It's either A or B" would be true (since A is guilty), so C tells the truth here.

So according to this, Case 1 gives us one truth-teller (C). But wait, the problem says "Only one of these people is telling the truth". So if that's the case, then culprit is A. But let me check again.

Wait, but hold on. Wait a second. If C says "It's either A or B", and in reality it is A, so that statement is true. However, if C is lying about who it is, maybe?

No, wait: In logic puzzles like this, when someone makes a claim about the culprit being X, Y, Z..., their statement is considered true if the culprit is one of those (for an "or" statement). So if they say "It's A or B", and the culprit is A, then that statement is true.

But here's another angle: In some puzzles, if someone says "It's either X or Y", but they are trying to indicate that it's exactly one of them (not both), which would be fine here since only one person is guilty. So in this problem, with four suspects and only one culprit, each statement refers to a single culprit.

Wait, the key might be that C's statement: "It's either A or B". If we take it as "the culprit is exactly one of A or B", then if the culprit is A or B, C is telling the truth. If the culprit is someone else, then lying.

Similarly for D: "It's B or C" meaning the culprit is exactly one of them.

So given that, let's re-examine Case 1:

Case 1: Culprit = A

- A says "B": lie
- B says "C": lie
- C says "A or B": true (since it's A)
- D says "B or C": lie

Therefore, only C is truthful. So that fits the condition of exactly one truth-teller.

But wait, according to this, the answer would be A.

But let me check the other cases again because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Case 2: Culprit = B

- A says "B": true
- B says "C": lie
- C says "A or B": true (since it's B)
- D says "B or C": true (since it's B)

Three truths. Not good.

Case3: Culprit=C

- A: lie
- B: truth
- C: lie (since culprit is not A or B)
- D: truth (culprit is C, which is in "B or C")

So two truths (B and D). Not okay.

Case4: Culprit=D

All statements are lies:

A says B – nope

B says C – nope

C says A/B – nope

D says B/C – nope

Zero truths. Doesn't fit the problem's condition.

Therefore, only Case1 works where culprit is A with C being truthful.

But wait, the problem says "the farmer comes back to his chicken coop to find the door open and all his chickens gone! He tells the sheriff..." So the sheriff is working out who is responsible among A,B,C,D. But according to our analysis, it's A.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait a second, in Case 1: If A is guilty, then C says "It's either A or B". Since A is guilty, that statement is true. However, the problem states that only one person is telling the truth. So according to this, yes, only C would be truthful.

But wait, hold on. Wait another thought. The problem says: "Only one of these people is telling the truth."

In some logic puzzles, if someone says "X or Y", it's a lie if it's neither X nor Y, but true otherwise. So in this case:

For C's statement: If culprit is A or B → C tells truth; else lies.

Similarly, D's statement: culprit is B or C → D tells truth; else lies.

So our previous analysis holds.

But here's a catch: In Case 1 (A guilty), only C is truthful. So that seems to fit.

Wait, but I have a doubt because sometimes these puzzles have the culprit as someone else. Let me check again.

Wait, another way: Maybe when C says "It's either A or B", they are saying it's one of them and not sure which, implying that they don't know for certain. But if in reality it is A or B, then their statement would still be considered true? Hmm.

Alternatively, could the problem interpret "I'm not sure which" as a lie? Like if C were truthful about it being A or B but unsure, but since they are lying, maybe?

Wait, this is tricky. If the puzzle expects that the entire statement must be true in all parts, then perhaps C's statement is a lie because they say "I'm not sure which" when actually they should be sure? But that seems odd.

Alternatively, if we take it that C's statement has two components: "It's either A or B" and "I'm not sure which". If the first part is true but the second part is a lie (i.e., they are sure), then overall the statement would be a lie. But this seems complicated.

Given that this is a puzzle, probably we're supposed to take their statements at face value: each person makes a single statement, and we determine if that entire statement is true or false based on who is guilty.

For example:

- A's statement: "It's B" → True iff culprit = B

- B's statement: "C" → True iff culprit = C

- C's statement: "Either A or B" → True iff culprit ∈ {A, B}

- D's statement: "B or C" → True iff culprit ∈ {B, C}

Assuming that's the case, then our previous analysis holds.

So with that interpretation:

Case 1 (culprit=A): Only C tells truth. So this is valid.

But wait, in some versions of similar puzzles, sometimes the person who is truthful has to be the one whose statement points to the culprit correctly, but here it's different.

Wait, according to this analysis, answer would be A.

But I recall a similar puzzle where the answer was different. Wait, let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in considering C's statement.

Wait, another angle: If only one person is truthful, then for each case:

Case 1: Culprit=A

Truth-tellers: C (since culprit ∈ {A,B})

Others lie.

So yes, one truth-teller. Okay.

Case 2: Culprit=B

Truth-tellers: A ("B"), C ("A/B"), D ("B/C") → three truths. Not good.

Case3: Culprit=C

Truth-tellers: B and D. Two people.

Case4: Culprit=D

No one truthful.

So only Case1 works. So answer is A.

But wait, the problem says "the sheriff... works out either A, B, C or D is responsible". Hmm. But according to this, culprit is A. But let me think again.

Wait, hold on. Wait, in Case 1: If A is guilty, then when he makes a statement saying "It's B", that's a lie. Makes sense. But here's the thing: The problem says "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So if C is truthful, then according to C's statement, culprit is either A or B. Which it is (A), so okay.

But let me check online... Wait, no, I shouldn't do that. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, another thought: If C says "It's either A or B", but in reality it's A, then C is telling the truth. But could C be lying by saying it's one of them? Like, if someone lies about it being A or B when it's actually not?

Wait, no: In standard logic puzzles, a statement like "X or Y" is considered true if X or Y (or both) are guilty. Since only one person is guilty here, it's either X or Y.

So with that in mind, our analysis holds.

But wait, I'm getting confused because sometimes in these puzzles the answer might be different.

Wait, let me consider another angle. Suppose the truthful person's statement must be correct, and everyone else lies.

If we suppose C is the truth-teller:

Then culprit is A or B.

Since only one person tells truth (C), then A, B, D are lying.

A says "B" → lie, so culprit ≠ B

B says "C" → lie, so culprit ≠ C

D says "B or C" → lie, so culprit ∉ {B,C}

Therefore, from C's statement: culprit ∈ {A,B}; and from A, B, D lying:

culprit ≠ B (from A), culprit ≠ C (from B), culprit ∉ {B,C} (from D)

So combining these:

culprit must be in {A} because:

- From C: {A,B}

- Not B (from A's lie)

Therefore, culprit = A.

Which matches our earlier Case1. So this works.

Now suppose instead that the truth-teller is someone else.

Let's try assuming A is truthful.

If A is truthful → culprit = B

Then:

B's statement: "C" must be a lie → culprit ≠ C (which holds, since culprit=B)

C's statement: "A or B" → since culprit=B, this would be true. But we supposed only A is truthful. Contradiction. So can't have A as truth-teller.

Similarly, if B is truthful:

culprit = C

Then:

C says "A or B" → lie, so culprit ∉ {A,B} (which holds since culprit=C)

D says "B or C" → true (since culprit=C). But then both B and D would be truthful. Contradiction.

If D is truthful:

culprit ∈ {B,C}

And A, B, C are lying.

A lies: culprit ≠ B

B lies: culprit ≠ C

So from A's lie: culprit ≠ B; from B's lie: culprit ≠ C

But D says culprit ∈ {B,C}, and both A and B are lying, so culprit is not in {B,C}. Contradiction. So D cannot be the truth-teller.

Therefore, only possible truth-teller is C, leading to culprit=A.

So according to this analysis, answer is A.

Wait, but I have a hesitation because sometimes these puzzles have nuances. Let me see.

Wait, when we assume that C is truthful (culprit = A or B), and others lie:

- A lies: so culprit ≠ B

- B lies: culprit ≠ C

- D lies: culprit ∉ {B,C}

Therefore:

culprit must be in {A} as above. So yes.

So this seems consistent.

But wait, the original problem says "the farmer comes back to his chicken coop to find the door open and all his chickens gone!" So it's a theft, but we're assuming one of A,B,C,D did it.

Given that analysis, answer is A.

But I vaguely recall similar puzzles where the answer was different. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, another check: If culprit is A, then:

A lies (says B), good

B says C (lie), good

C truthfully says A or B, good

D lies about B/C, good.

Yes, only one truth-teller. Seems to fit.

Hmm. So why do I have a doubt? Maybe because sometimes people miscount.

Wait, let's try to see if there's another possible case.

Suppose someone else is truthful.

We did check all:

If A truthful → culprit=B leads to contradiction (C also truthful)

B truthful → culprit=C leads to D also truthful

D truthful → impossible

So only C can be truthful, leading to culprit=A.

Therefore, the answer should be A.

But wait, hold on. Wait in some versions of this puzzle, the answer is different because of the interpretation of "either... or..." statements.

Wait, for example, if someone says "It's either A or B", does that mean exactly one? In common language, yes. So since there is only one culprit, it's fine.

Alternatively, in formal logic, "or" can be inclusive, but here it doesn't matter since only one person is guilty.

I think the analysis holds. So culprit is A.

But wait, let me check once more.

Suppose culprit is A:

- A: lie

- B: lie

- C: truth

- D: lie

Only one truth-teller: yes.

Perfect.

Alternatively, if someone else...

Wait, another way: Let's list all possibilities with the number of truths.

Case 1: A guilty → 1 truth (C)

Case2: B guilty → 3 truths

Case3: C guilty → 2 truths

Case4: D guilty → 0 truths

So only Case1 has exactly one truth. Therefore, answer is A.

Hmm. So according to this reasoning, the culprit is A. But I want to make sure.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So in the scenario where A is guilty, C is truthful. So that's consistent.

But let me think: If the sheriff is trying to figure out who did it based on only one truth-teller. According to this, answer is A.

Wait, but I recall a similar problem where the solution was D, but maybe not exactly the same.

Alternatively, could there be a mistake in considering C's statement?

Suppose that when C says "It's either A or B", they are trying to say it's one of them and they don't know which. If we take it as C is lying about the entire thing because he doesn't know (but actually, he does know), but no, in this context, it's a statement about who did it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that C's statement is a lie because even though it's A or B, they are saying "I'm not sure which", implying that they think it's one of them but aren't certain. However, if it actually is one of them, then their assertion could be considered truthful in part.

But I think in the context of these puzzles, we usually go with the factual claim without considering the uncertainty as a separate truth element. So C's statement "It's either A or B" would be true if culprit is A or B, regardless of their certainty.

Given that, our analysis holds.

I think after careful consideration, the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me check an example.

Suppose someone says: "The suspect is either X or Y". If it's indeed X or Y, then the statement is true. So if C says this and it's A, then it's a true statement. Therefore, yes, C tells truth in that case.

Therefore, I think the answer is A.

But now I'm confused because when I first thought of similar puzzles, sometimes the culprit was someone else.

Wait, let's try to see what happens if the answer were D.

If we assume culprit=D:

- All statements are lies. But problem says one person tells truth. So invalid.

Culprit=B: three truths. Nope.

Culprit=C: two truths.

So yeah, only A works.

Hmm. I think after thorough analysis, the answer is A.

But let me see if the problem might have a typo or different interpretation.

Wait, D says "It's B...or C. One of the two!" So maybe D is saying it's exactly one of them (not both), but since only one culprit exists, it doesn't matter.

No, still holds.

Okay, I think I've verified this multiple times. The answer should be A.

Wait, wait a second! Hold on!

Wait, in Case 1: If culprit=A, then C says "It's either A or B". So C is telling the truth. But according to the problem statement, "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So if that's the case, then yes.

But here's a catch I just thought of: When someone lies about who it is, they might be lying in a way that their statement could still be technically true or not.

Wait, but no—if we strictly take it as:

- A says culprit = B

- B says culprit = C

- C says culprit ∈ {A,B}

- D says culprit ∈ {B,C}

Then yes.

But another angle: In some puzzles, if a person says "X", when they are lying, they might be saying someone else. But here all statements are direct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in Case 1, C's statement being true leads to two possibilities (A or B), but since we're assuming only one truth-teller, it works out.

Yes, I think this holds.

I think after all this, the answer is A. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes these puzzles have twists.

Wait, let me do a final check.

Assume culprit = A:

- A lies (says B)

- B lies (says C)

- C truth (A/B)

- D lies (B/C)

One truth: yes.

Perfect.

If someone claims it's D, but no.

Alright, I think the answer is A. But wait, hold on! Wait in some sources, similar puzzles have different answers because of the interpretation of "either... or..." as exclusive. But even so, since only one person did it, it doesn't matter.

Alternatively, could it be that when C says "It's either A or B", they are lying because it's actually one specific person? No, in standard logic puzzles like this, an "or" statement is true if at least one is correct.

Wait, for example: If I say "The culprit is either A or B", and the culprit is A, then my statement is true. So C would be telling the truth.

Yes.

So after careful analysis, I think the answer is A.

But wait! Wait another thought: The problem says "the sheriff... works out either A, B, C or D is responsible". But the sheriff is a person who's not one of them? Maybe that's irrelevant.

Wait, no. The key point remains: four suspects, only one truth-teller.

Given all this, I think A is guilty.

But now I recall that in some versions of this exact puzzle (I think it's from a known source), the answer is D. Wait, but according to our analysis it's not.

Wait, let me try to search my memory. There's a classic puzzle where four people are involved, each making statements about who did it, and only one truth-teller. The solution often involves the liar having to be consistent in their lies.

Wait, for instance: In this exact setup (A says B, B says C, C says A or B, D says B or C), with one truth-teller.

After a quick recall, I think in some formulations, the answer is D. Wait, no, maybe not.

Alternatively, let's suppose that when C says "It's either A or B", they are saying it's exactly one of them and they don't know which. If we interpret that their entire statement is a lie because, for example, if the culprit were outside A/B, then their statement would be false; but since we have to consider the liar's perspective.

Wait, no—if C is lying, then the culprit is not A or B.

But in our analysis, when we suppose truth-teller=C, it's consistent.

I think my initial analysis holds. Given time invested, I will go with culprit=A.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{A}

# Answer

To solve this logic puzzle, we analyze the statements of four individuals — A, B, C, and D — under the condition that **only one of them is telling the truth**, and the rest are lying. The goal is to determine **who among A, B, C, or D is actually responsible** for the chickens being stolen.

---

### Step 1: List of Statements

- **A**: "It's B who's to blame!"
- **B**: "C's the culprit."
- **C**: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..."
- **D**: "It's B...or C. One of the two!"

We interpret these statements as follows:

- A says: Culprit = B
- B says: Culprit = C
- C says: Culprit ∈ {A, B}
- D says: Culprit ∈ {B, C}

Only **one** of these four statements is true.

---

### Step 2: Try Each Person as the Guilty One

We evaluate each scenario by checking how many people would be telling the truth in that case.

#### ✅ Case 1: **A is guilty**

- A says "It's B" → **False**
- B says "C" → **False**
- C says "It's either A or B" → **True** (since culprit = A)
- D says "It's B or C" → **False**

✅ **Only one truth-teller**: C  
✔️ This matches the condition of **only one person telling the truth**

#### ❌ Case 2: **B is guilty**

- A says "It's B" → **True**
- B says "C" → **False**
- C says "It's either A or B" → **True** (since culprit = B)
- D says "It's B or C" → **True** (since culprit = B)

❌ **Three truth-tellers**: A, C, D  
→ Not valid

#### ❌ Case 3: **C is guilty**

- A says "It's B" → **False**
- B says "C" → **True**
- C says "It's either A or B" → **False** (culprit = C)
- D says "It's B or C" → **True** (since culprit = C)

❌ **Two truth-tellers**: B, D  
→ Not valid

#### ❌ Case 4: **D is guilty**

- A says "It's B" → **False**
- B says "C" → **False**
- C says "It's either A or B" → **False** (culprit = D)
- D says "It's B or C" → **False**

❌ **Zero truth-tellers**  
→ Not valid

---

### Step 3: Conclusion

Only **Case 1**, where **A is guilty**, results in exactly **one person telling the truth** — **C**.

All other cases violate the condition that only **one person is telling the truth**.

This is consistent with the logic of the puzzle, and no ambiguity remains if we interpret C’s statement as: *“The culprit is either A or B”* (a true statement when A is guilty), not as a claim of uncertainty that affects the truth value.

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{A}
$$
