We need to solve a logic puzzle.

We have four suspects: A, B, C, D. The statements:

- Statement S_A: "It's B who's to blame!" (i.e., B did it.)
- Statement S_B: "C's the culprit. No doubt about it." (C did it.)
- Statement S_C: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." (A or B did it.)
- Statement S_D: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" (B or C did it.)

We are told only one person is telling the truth. So exactly one statement is true, and the other three statements are false.

We need to find out who actually committed the crime, given that only one statement is correct.

Let's denote the actual culprit as X ∈ {A,B,C,D}. We need to check each scenario and see which yields exactly one true statement.

We also might consider the logical truth of each statement in relation to X. But careful: The statements are about "who did it." So we interpret them as:

- S_A: B did it (i.e., X = B).
- S_B: C did it (X = C).
- S_C: It's either A or B. That means X ∈ {A,B}. But is that statement "I'm not sure which" meaning ambiguous? The truth of the statement is that at least one of them did it, but maybe both? But it's a single culprit. So if X is A or B, then S_C is true; else false.

- S_D: It's B...or C. One of the two! Means X ∈ {B,C}. If X is B or C, statement D is true; else false.

We need exactly one statement to be true.

Let's evaluate for each possible culprit:

Case 1: X = A (A did it). Then:

- S_A: "B did it" → false.
- S_B: "C did it" → false.
- S_C: "Either A or B" → true, because A is indeed the culprit. So S_C is true.
- S_D: "B or C" → false.

Thus exactly one statement (S_C) is true. That satisfies condition. So X = A seems to be a possible solution. But we must check if any other case also yields exactly one truth.

Case 2: X = B (B did it). Then:

- S_A: "B did it" → true.
- S_B: "C did it" → false.
- S_C: "Either A or B" → true, because B is culprit. So S_C also true.
- S_D: "B or C" → true (since B). So 3 statements are true. Not allowed.

Case 3: X = C. Then:

- S_A: false
- S_B: true
- S_C: false? Wait: S_C says "Either A or B." Since culprit is C, it's not A or B; so false.
- S_D: "B or C" → true (C). So we have two truths: S_B and S_D. Not allowed.

Case 4: X = D. Then:

- S_A: false
- S_B: false
- S_C: false? Wait: S_C says A or B; but culprit is D, so false.
- S_D: "B or C" → false.

Thus zero statements are true. Not allowed.

Therefore the only scenario that yields exactly one truth is X = A (A did it). So answer: A is responsible.

But we must consider nuance: The statement of each person might not be exactly as we interpret. Let's examine each phrase:

- A says: "It's B who's to blame!" That is a claim that B did it. It's false if culprit is not B. But if the culprit is B, it's true.

- B says: "C's the culprit. No doubt about it." Claim C did it. So same.

- C says: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." That is ambiguous but the statement is a claim that the culprit is either A or B. It could be considered as "the culprit is one of A or B" - which is true if X ∈ {A,B}. If X = A or B, then S_C is true; else false.

- D says: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" That indicates that the culprit is either B or C. So it's true if X ∈ {B,C}.

Thus our logic stands. Only scenario with exactly one truth is X = A. So answer: A did it.

However, we should also consider potential alternative interpretation: For S_C and S_D, maybe they are ambiguous statements that could be partially correct or incorrectly phrased? But typical puzzle expects each statement to be either fully true or fully false. We might need to treat "Either A or B" as a disjunction; if X is A, it's true; if X is B, also true; else false. Similarly for D.

Thus answer: A did it.

But we may want to double-check that the puzzle states only one of these people is telling the truth. So indeed exactly one statement is true. That leads to culprit = A.

However, we might need to consider if any other scenario yields zero or more than one truth but still "only one is telling the truth" could be ambiguous? But it's clear.

But let's double-check: Suppose the actual culprit is B. Then S_A is true; S_B false; S_C true; S_D true. So 3 truths. Not allowed. If X = C, then S_B true; S_D true; others false. Two truths. Not allowed. If X = D, none true. Not allowed.

Thus answer: A did it.

But let's check if there's any hidden nuance about "Only one of these people is telling the truth" meaning exactly one statement among them is true? Yes.

However, maybe we misinterpret S_C's claim "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." Could be considered as a partial statement: The person is uncertain between A and B. But if the culprit is A, then the statement is partially correct but still might be considered true? Typically in puzzles, we treat it as a proposition that can be evaluated truthfully: "The culprit is either A or B" is indeed a statement; it's true if the culprit is A or B. So it's okay.

But some may argue that the phrase "I'm not sure which..." indicates uncertainty but does not assert any fact. But in logic puzzles, we treat it as an assertion that at least one of them did it. So fine.

Also D's "It's B...or C. One of the two!" similarly is a statement: The culprit is either B or C. Evaluate truth accordingly.

Thus answer: A is responsible.

But let's consider if there could be some other interpretation: Suppose we treat S_C as ambiguous and thus not considered "telling the truth" because it's uncertain? But then the puzzle says only one person is telling the truth, meaning exactly one statement must be fully true. So maybe we should interpret each person's entire utterance as a single proposition; if it contains uncertainty or speculation, maybe it's considered false if it's not certain? But that would complicate.

Alternatively, maybe we treat S_C's statement as "Either A or B did it" and he is uncertain which one. That might be considered partially true: It's not certain which, but the proposition itself could be true if either A or B did it. So still same as above.

Thus answer remains A.

But let's check again: Could there be any scenario where S_C's statement is false but S_A is true? Let's test X = B: S_A true; S_B false; S_C true (since X= B); S_D true (since X=B). So 3 truths. Not allowed. So no.

Thus only solution: A did it.

But maybe we need to consider that the puzzle might have trick: The person telling the truth is not necessarily a suspect? Wait, "Only one of these people is telling the truth." Means exactly one statement among them is true. But maybe each person could be lying or telling truth. We found scenario with A being culprit yields S_C as only truth. So C tells truth while others lie. That means C is truthful but not the culprit. That's okay.

But we should check if there's any other possibility: Suppose X = D, then none of statements are true; but that would violate "only one telling the truth" because zero truths. So no.

Thus answer remains A did it.

However, some might argue that in scenario with X=A, S_C's statement is true but also includes a claim about not knowing which between A or B. But if we consider that to be partially correct: It's either A or B; indeed it's A. So the statement "Either A or B" is true. The part "I'm not sure which" doesn't add any false content; it simply expresses uncertainty. So overall statement might still be considered truthful? In logic puzzles, we treat it as a single proposition.

Thus answer: A did it.

But let's think if there are any other constraints like "All four are pointing fingers at each other." That means each suspects someone else: A points to B; B points to C; C says either A or B; D says B or C. So it's consistent with scenario where A is culprit: then A's statement is false (he blames B incorrectly); B's statement false; D's statement false; C's statement true.

Thus the puzzle solved.

But maybe we need to produce explanation: Only one person telling truth means only one statement is correct. Suppose it were B, then 3 statements would be correct etc. So only possibility is A.

Let's craft final answer accordingly:

- If A did it: S_A false; S_B false; S_C true; S_D false → exactly one true statement (C). Works.
- All other possibilities yield more than one truth or none.

Thus the culprit is A.

But we might want to mention that the puzzle's wording "Only one of these people is telling the truth." implies exactly one statement is correct. So we need to test each scenario. Provide reasoning as above.

Alternatively, we could consider a different reading: The statements are about blame; maybe they refer to who is responsible for the chickens being gone? That might be someone else like "the person who opens the door" but not necessarily the culprit. But no, it's a straightforward logic puzzle.

Thus answer: A did it.

But let's check if any trick: Suppose D says "It's B...or C. One of the two!" This could be interpreted as "B or C is the culprit," but maybe it's ambiguous: Could also be that B or C is responsible for something else? But no, likely means B or C did it. So same.

Thus final answer: A is the culprit; C tells truth.

But perhaps we need to elaborate more elegantly: We can denote T_i as truth of statement i. We need exactly one true. Evaluate each case. Provide reasoning.

Also we might mention that the puzzle has unique solution. It's typical logic puzzle.

Let's produce a final answer accordingly.

# Answer

Let’s call the four statements:

| Person | Statement | Means |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **A** | “It’s B who did it.” | \(X=B\) |
| **B** | “C did it.” | \(X=C\) |
| **C** | “Either A or B did it (I’m not sure which).” | \(X=A \text{ or } X=B\) |
| **D** | “It’s B …or C – one of the two!” | \(X=B \text{ or } X=C\) |

Only one statement can be true.

---

### Test each possible culprit

1. **If A did it** (\(X=A\))

   * S_A : false (B didn’t do it)
   * S_B : false (C didn’t do it)
   * S_C : true  (the culprit is either A or B → here A)
   * S_D : false (neither B nor C)

   **Exactly one truth** – works.

2. **If B did it** (\(X=B\))

   * S_A : true
   * S_B : false
   * S_C : true  (B is one of A or B)
   * S_D : true  (B is one of B or C)

   Three truths – not allowed.

3. **If C did it** (\(X=C\))

   * S_A : false
   * S_B : true
   * S_C : false  (neither A nor B)
   * S_D : true  (C is one of B or C)

   Two truths – not allowed.

4. **If D did it** (\(X=D\))

   * S_A : false
   * S_B : false
   * S_C : false
   * S_D : false

   No truth – not allowed.

The only scenario that satisfies the condition “exactly one statement is true” is when **A** is the culprit.  
In that case, C’s claim (“either A or B”) happens to be the sole truthful statement, while all others lie. 

So the chickens were stolen by **A**.
