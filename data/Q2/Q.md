# Question
A farmer comes back to his chicken coop to find the door open and all his chickens gone! He tells the sheriff, who works out either A, B, C or D is responsible, but they're all pointing fingers at each other.

- A: "It's B who's to blame!"
- B: "C's the culprit. No doubt about it."
- C: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..."
- D: "It's B...or C. One of the two!"

Only one of these people is telling the truth. Can you work out who is to blame for this?
