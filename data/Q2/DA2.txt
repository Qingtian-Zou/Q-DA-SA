[Thinking]
We have a puzzle. Four suspects A, B, C, D; each makes a statement. Only one of them tells the truth. We must determine which suspect actually caused the theft. The statements:

A: "It's B who's to blame!"
B: "C's the culprit. No doubt about it."
C: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..."
D: "It's B...or C. One of the two!"

We assume each statement is a claim about who is responsible. We need to find a consistent assignment where exactly one statement is true and three are false, given that only one suspect actually did it. Also we may consider if more than one could be culprit? The story says "who is to blame for this?" implies one person.

We must parse each statement: A claims B is the culprit. B claims C is the culprit. C says it's either A or B (so C claims that the culprit is A or B, but doesn't say which). D says it's B or C (one of those two).

We need to test possibilities. Let's denote culprit X ∈ {A,B,C,D}. Evaluate each statement truth value.

Define statements:

S_A: "B is culprit." So S_A true iff culprit = B.

S_B: "C is culprit." True iff culprit = C.

S_C: "Either A or B is culprit." That means culprit ∈ {A,B}.

S_D: "Either B or C is culprit." Means culprit ∈ {B,C}.

We need exactly one of S_A,S_B,S_C,S_D true. Also we must have a single culprit? The puzzle says only one of these people is telling the truth, but doesn't explicitly say that there is exactly one culprit; but likely yes. We'll consider each possible culprit and see which assignment yields exactly one true statement.

Case 1: Culprit = A.
S_A false (since B not culprit). S_B false (C not culprit). S_C true? Culprit ∈ {A,B}. Yes, A is in set => true. S_D false (B or C? No). So we have exactly one true statement: S_C. That satisfies condition. So if culprit = A, only C's statement is true.

Case 2: Culprit = B.
S_A true (B is culprit). S_B false (C not culprit). S_C true? Culprit ∈ {A,B} => yes B is in set => true. S_D true? Culprit ∈ {B,C} => yes B => true. That gives 3 true statements, not allowed.

Case 3: Culprit = C.
S_A false (not B). S_B true (C culprit). S_C false? Culprit ∈ {A,B}? No. So false. S_D true? Culprit ∈ {B,C} => yes C. That gives two truths: S_B and S_D.

Case 4: Culprit = D.
S_A false, S_B false, S_C false (not A or B), S_D false (not B or C). Then zero truths; not allowed.

Thus only culprit that yields exactly one truth is A. So the thief is A? Wait but statement by C would be true; meaning "It's either A or B." That matches with culprit = A. But we have to ensure that only one of them telling truth. C's statement is true, others false. So yes.

But check: does C say "I'm not sure which..." meaning ambiguous? It's still a claim that the culprit is either A or B; that would be considered truthful if indeed culprit is A (or B). Since it's a true statement albeit ambiguous. So this puzzle solution: The thief is A, and only C tells truth.

But wait: We must double-check if there is any nuance about "only one of these people is telling the truth" meaning exactly one? Usually yes. But we should consider possibility that each suspect might have said multiple statements; but the puzzle says "A: 'It's B...'" etc. So each statement may contain more than one claim? For example, D's statement: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" That is basically a single claim.

Ok final answer: A stole the chickens; only C tells truth.

But maybe there is twist: The puzzle might require reasoning about possibility that each suspect could be telling truth about part of their statement? For example, D says "B or C" and "One of the two." It's ambiguous but still a single claim. So we treat as one statement.

Thus answer: A did it; only C's statement is true.

We can present explanation:

Suppose culprit B -> 3 truths
Culprit C -> 2 truths
Culprit D -> 0 truths
Culprit A -> exactly one truth (C).
Hence culprit must be A. And the truthful person is C.

We can also mention that if only one suspect told truth, then the thief can't be B or C because they'd produce more than one truth; and cannot be D because no statements would be true; so only possibility left is A. Therefore the culprit is A and the liar's identity etc.

But the puzzle says "Only one of these people is telling the truth." It might refer to any of them? So we found that if culprit = A, C tells truth; others lie. Works.

Thus final answer: The thief was A, and only C told truth (the rest lied). Let's produce explanation accordingly.

Let's craft final response: The culprit is A; only C's statement ("Either A or B") is true; all other statements false. Provide reasoning steps.

Edge Cases: Could the liar be a suspect? The puzzle says "Only one of these people is telling the truth." That means three are lying, but they may not be the thief. We found culprit = A, who also lies. So it's possible that the thief lies about being B? Wait A's statement is "B is to blame," which is false. So A lied; consistent.

Thus final answer: The thief is A; C tells truth. Provide explanation.

[Answer]
Answer – The chickens were stolen by A, and only C was telling the truth.

How we get there
Let us write each person’s claim as a simple statement about who actually did it.

Person	Claim	Truth value if the culprit is …
A	“B stole the chickens.”	true only when B is the culprit.
B	“C stole the chickens.”	true only when C is the culprit.
C	“It’s either A or B.”	true if the culprit is A or B.
D	“It’s B …or C.”	true if the culprit is B or C.
We need exactly one of these statements to be true, because only one person is telling the truth.

Test each possible culprit
If A stole them

A: false (claims B)
B: false (claims C)
C: true (A or B → A is indeed a possibility)
D: false (B or C)
Exactly one truth – C’s statement.

If B stole them

A: true
B: false
C: true (B is in the set {A,B})
D: true
Three truths – not allowed.

If C stole them

A: false
B: true
C: false (C isn’t A or B)
D: true
Two truths – not allowed.

If D stole them

All four statements are false.
Zero truths – not allowed.

Only the first scenario yields exactly one truth. Therefore the thief must be A.

Who was telling the truth?
With A as culprit, only C’s statement (“It’s either A or B”) is correct; all other claims are lies. Thus

C tells the truth,
A, B, D lie.
So the chickens were stolen by A, and the sole truthful witness was C.
