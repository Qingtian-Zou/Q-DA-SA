Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have four suspects: A, B, C, D. Only one of them is telling the truth, and the rest are lying. The goal is to find out who the actual culprit is.

First, let me list out what each person said:

- A says: "It's B who's to blame!"
- B says: "C's the culprit. No doubt about it."
- C says: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..."
- D says: "It's B...or C. One of the two!"

Hmm. So, each of them is making a statement. Since only one is telling the truth, three are lying. We need to test each possibility (i.e., assume each person is the culprit) and see which scenario results in exactly one truthful statement.

Let me start by assuming each person is the culprit and check the statements.

Case 1: Suppose A is the culprit.

If A is guilty, then:

- A's statement: "It's B who's to blame!" → False (since A is guilty)
- B's statement: "C's the culprit." → False (C is innocent)
- C's statement: "It's either A or B." → True (A is guilty)
- D's statement: "It's B or C." → False (neither B nor C is guilty)

Wait, so in this case, C is telling the truth. That would mean only C is truthful, which would make this case possible? But wait, hold on. Wait, the problem states that only one of these people is telling the truth. So if in this case C is truthful and others are lying, then this would be a possible scenario. Hmm. But let's check again.

Wait, if A is guilty, then:

A's claim is false (correct, since it's A, not B)
B's claim is false (C is not guilty)
C's claim: "It's either A or B." Since A is guilty, this statement is true. So C is truthful.
D's claim: "It's B or C." Since it's A, this is false.

So in this case, only C is truthful. So that would mean if A is guilty, then C is the truth-teller. But the problem says only one is truthful, so this case would be possible. Wait, but we need to check all cases.

But wait, hold on. Let's make sure. The problem says "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So in this case, if A is guilty, then C is truthful. So that would be a scenario where only one person (C) is truthful. Hmm. But the answer could be A? Wait, but let's check other cases.

Case 2: Suppose B is the culprit.

Then:

A's statement: "It's B." → True (so A is truthful)
B's statement: "C is guilty." → False
C's statement: "It's either A or B." → True (since B is guilty)
D's statement: "It's B or C." → True (B is guilty)

Wait, so in this case, A, C, D are all telling the truth. That's three truths, which is way more than one. So this case is invalid. So B cannot be the culprit.

Case 3: Suppose C is the culprit.

Then:

A's statement: "It's B." → False
B's statement: "C is guilty." → True
C's statement: "It's either A or B." → False (C is guilty)
D's statement: "It's B or C." → True (C is guilty)

So here, B and D are both truthful. That's two truths, which violates the "only one truth" condition. So C can't be the culprit.

Case 4: Suppose D is the culprit.

Then:

A's statement: "It's B." → False
B's statement: "C is guilty." → False
C's statement: "It's either A or B." → False
D's statement: "It's B or C." → False

Wait, so in this case, all four are lying. But the problem states that only one is telling the truth. So this case is impossible.

Wait, so according to this analysis:

Case 1 (A guilty): C is truthful → 1 truth (valid)
Case 2 (B guilty): 3 truths (invalid)
Case 3 (C guilty): 2 truths (invalid)
Case 4 (D guilty): 0 truths (invalid)

So according to this, only Case 1 is possible, meaning A is guilty, and C is truthful.

But wait, the problem says "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So in this case, C is the only truth-teller, so A is guilty.

But wait, hold on. Wait, in the problem statement: "the sheriff... works out either A, B, C or D is responsible". So the culprit is one of them. So according to this analysis, answer would be A.

But wait, wait a second. Let me check again.

Wait, in Case 1: If A is guilty, then C says "It's either A or B". So C is saying that the culprit is A or B. Since A is guilty, that statement is true. So C is truthful.

But the problem says that only one person is telling the truth. So in this scenario, yes, only C is truthful. So that would make A the culprit.

But wait, hold on. Let me check again.

Wait, another way: Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting C's statement.

C says: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..."

So C is saying that the culprit is A or B, but not sure which. So if the culprit is A, then C's statement is true (since it's either A or B). If culprit is B, same. If culprit is C or D, then C's statement is false.

Similarly, D says: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" So D is saying it's B or C (but not necessarily both). So if culprit is B or C, then D's statement is true.

Okay, so going back.

Case 1: A guilty.

A: False

B: False

C: True

D: False

So only C is truthful. So this works.

Case 2: B guilty.

A: True

B: False

C: True (since culprit is B, which is in A or B)

D: True (since culprit is B, which is in B or C)

So three truths. Not possible.

Case 3: C guilty.

A: False

B: True

C: False (culprit is C, not A or B)

D: True (culprit is C)

So B and D truthful. Two truths. Not possible.

Case 4: D guilty.

A: False

B: False

C: False

D: False

All lying. Not possible.

Therefore, only Case 1 works. So culprit is A.

Wait, but the problem says "the sheriff... works out either A, B, C or D is responsible". So according to this, answer is A.

But wait, I have a doubt here because sometimes these puzzles have a twist. Let me check again.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the problem is that when someone says "It's either A or B", does that mean exactly one of them? Hmm, but C says "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." So it's a bit ambiguous. But in logic puzzles like this, usually "either X or Y" means at least one, unless specified as exclusive. But in this context, probably C is saying the culprit is A or B (so inclusive or). So if culprit is A, then C's statement is true.

But according to the analysis, only Case 1 works.

Wait, but let me check online if this is a known puzzle. Wait, no, I shouldn't do that. Let me think again.

Wait, another way: Suppose the answer is D. Wait, no, in Case 4, all are lying. But the problem states that only one is truthful, so Case 4 has zero, which is invalid.

Wait, but here's a thought: In some logic puzzles, the person who is lying might have a statement that is technically true or false depending on interpretation. Let's check.

Wait, D says: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" So D is asserting that it's B or C (exactly one? Or at least one? In common language, "B or C" usually means one of them, not both). So if culprit is B or C, then D is truthful.

Similarly, C says "It's either A or B". So if culprit is A or B, then C's statement is true.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the farmer found the door open and all chickens gone. So only one culprit.

Wait, according to our analysis, Case 1 (A guilty) leads to C being truthful, others lying. So that works.

But let me think again. Wait, in some similar puzzles, sometimes the truth-teller's statement has to be the only true one, but here it seems okay.

Wait, but wait another thought: If A is guilty, then C says "It's either A or B". So C is correct, so C is truthful. But the problem says only one is truthful, so that's okay.

But wait, the problem says "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So in this case, yes, only C.

But I vaguely recall a similar puzzle where the answer was D, but maybe not.

Wait, let's try to think differently.

Suppose the culprit is D.

Then:

A lies (says B), B lies (says C), C lies (says A or B), D lies (says B or C). So all four lying. But problem states that one is truthful, so invalid.

Culprit is C:

A lies, B tells truth (C is culprit), C lies (since culprit is C, not A or B), D tells truth (C is in B or C). So two truths. Not good.

Culprit is B:

A tells truth, B lies, C tells truth (B is A or B), D tells truth (B is in B or C). Three truths. Nope.

Culprit is A:

A lies, B lies, C tells truth, D lies. One truth. So this works.

Hmm. So according to this, answer is A.

But wait, I have a doubt because maybe the problem is designed so that the answer is different. Wait, let's check C's statement again.

C says: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..."

So if C is saying "it's either A or B", but in reality it's A, then C is correct. So C's statement is true.

But in some logic puzzles, when someone says "I'm not sure which", it might imply that they don't know, but in this case, the statement is that it's either A or B. So if the culprit is A, then C's statement is true, regardless of the "I'm not sure" part. Hmm.

Wait, the "I'm not sure which" might be part of C's statement, but in terms of truthfulness, if the statement "It's either A or B" is true, then C is truthful, even if they are unsure. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the "I'm not sure which" is a lie, but the problem is that we have to take the entire statement as a whole.

Wait, in logic puzzles like this, usually the entire statement is considered. So if someone says "X is guilty, and Y is guilty", then we take the entire statement as a conjunction. But here, C says "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." So the first part is a claim about who it is, the second part is an expression of uncertainty.

But in terms of truthfulness, the "I'm not sure which" part is a bit tricky. If the culprit is A, then C's statement "It's either A or B" is true, and "I'm not sure which" is a bit odd because if it's A, then C knows it's A? Wait, no, the problem says "C: 'It's either A or B. I'm not sure which...'" So C is claiming that the culprit is A or B, and also that they don't know which. But in the context of the puzzle, we have to assume that the truthfulness of the entire statement is based on the factual correctness of the claim. The "I'm not sure" part might be a lie or truth depending on the situation.

Wait, this complicates things. Because if the culprit is A, then C's statement that "it's either A or B" is true, but C says "I'm not sure which". If C actually knows it's A, then they would be lying about not knowing. But in the puzzle context, we usually don't consider the speaker's knowledge but rather the factual truth of the statement.

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me see.

In many logic puzzles, when someone says "I don't know", it's considered a statement that is true or false based on the actual knowledge, but in this case, the problem is about the truthfulness of their accusation.

Wait, maybe the "I'm not sure which" is just part of the statement's phrasing and not a claim that they don't know. Maybe it's just C saying "It's either A or B, and I don't know which one", but in the context of the puzzle, we have to take the entire statement as a single claim. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that C's statement "It's either A or B" is a true statement (if culprit is A or B), and the rest is just flavor text. So regardless of the "I'm not sure", if the culprit is A or B, then C's statement is true.

Given that, our initial analysis holds.

So according to that, culprit is A.

Wait, but I have a nagging doubt because sometimes these puzzles have a different answer. Wait, let's check another angle.

Suppose that the truth-teller is D.

If D is truthful, then culprit is B or C.

But we need only one truth-teller.

So suppose D is truthful (culprit is B or C), and others are lying.

If culprit is B:

A says B is guilty → truth. But we supposed D is the only truth-teller, so contradiction.

If culprit is C:

B says C is guilty → truth. Again, contradiction. So D cannot be the only truth-teller.

Similarly, if A is truthful (culprit is B), then:

A truth, so culprit is B.

Then C says it's A or B → true. So two truths (A and C). Not allowed.

If B is truthful (culprit is C), then:

B truth, C says it's A or B → false (culprit is C), D says B or C → true (culprit is C). So B and D truthful. Two truths.

If C is truthful (culprit is A or B):

Case 1: culprit A.

Then C truthful, others lying. As before.

Case 2: culprit B.

Then C truthful, A truthful (says B), D truthful (says B or C). So three truths.

So only when culprit is A, C is truthful and others lie.

Therefore, answer is A.

Wait, but I'm confused because I recall a similar problem where the answer was D, but maybe not.

Wait, let's suppose that the problem is from a specific source. Wait, no, I shouldn't assume.

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in my analysis.

Wait, another way: Let's tabulate all possibilities.

We have four suspects. For each suspect being guilty, count the number of truthful statements.

Let me make a table.

Case 1: A guilty

A: B? No → False

B: C? No → False

C: A or B? Yes → True

D: B or C? No → False

Truth count: 1 (C)

Case 2: B guilty

A: B? Yes → True

B: C? No → False

C: A or B? Yes → True

D: B or C? Yes → True

Truth count: 3

Case 3: C guilty

A: B? No → False

B: C? Yes → True

C: A or B? No → False

D: B or C? Yes → True

Truth count: 2

Case 4: D guilty

A: B? No → False

B: C? No → False

C: A or B? No → False

D: B or C? No → False

Truth count: 0

So according to this table, only Case 1 has exactly 1 truth-teller. Therefore, culprit is A.

Hmm. So the answer should be A.

But wait, the problem says "the sheriff... works out either A, B, C or D is responsible". So the sheriff is the one who's trying to figure it out, but according to the analysis, it's A.

Wait, but maybe the problem is designed so that you have to consider that when someone says "It's either A or B", they might be lying about the "either...or", but in logic puzzles, usually, the statements are taken at face value.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation of D's statement.

D says: "It's B...or C. One of the two!"

So does "one of the two" mean exactly one? If the culprit is both B and C, but in this problem it's only one culprit, so it's irrelevant. So D is saying it's B or C (exclusive or inclusive). In common language, "one of the two" implies exactly one, but in this context, probably D is saying it's either B or C (at least one). But since only one culprit exists, it's exactly one.

But regardless, in our analysis, it's covered.

Wait, another angle: If the culprit is D, then all are lying. But the problem states that only one is truthful, so that's invalid. So D can't be guilty.

So according to this, answer is A.

But I have a doubt because sometimes in these puzzles, the truth-teller's statement has to be the only one, but in this case, it fits.

Wait, let me check with another approach.

Assume each person is the truth-teller and see if the rest are lying.

Assume A is truthful: Then culprit is B.

But if culprit is B, then:

- B's statement: "C is guilty" → lie (so B is lying, which is consistent)
- C's statement: "A or B" → true (since culprit is B), so C would also be truthful. But we assumed only A is truthful. Contradiction. So A cannot be the truth-teller.

Assume B is truthful: Culprit is C.

Then:

- A's statement: "B" → lie (good)
- C's statement: "A or B" → lie (good, since culprit is C)
- D's statement: "B or C" → true (culprit is C), so D would also be truthful. Contradiction (two truths). So B can't be the truth-teller.

Assume C is truthful: Culprit is A or B.

If culprit is A:

- A's statement: lie
- B's statement: lie
- D's statement: lie
So only C truthful. This works.

If culprit is B:

- A's statement: truth → contradicts C being the only truth-teller. So only culprit A is possible here.

Assume D is truthful: Culprit is B or C.

If culprit is B:

- A's statement: truth → contradiction.

If culprit is C:

- B's statement: truth → contradiction.

So D cannot be the only truth-teller.

Therefore, only possible scenario is C is truthful, culprit is A.

So the answer is A.

Wait, but the problem says "the sheriff... works out either A, B, C or D is responsible". So the answer is A.

But I'm a bit confused because I have a memory of a similar problem where the answer was different, but given the analysis here, it seems A is the culprit.

Wait, let me check once more.

If culprit is A:

A lies (says B)

B lies (says C)

C tells truth (A or B)

D lies (says B or C)

Yes, only one truth. So it fits.

Therefore, the culprit is A.

But wait, the problem says "the farmer comes back to his chicken coop to find the door open and all his chickens gone". So the culprit is the one who took the chickens. So according to this, A is the culprit.

Hmm. I think the answer is A.

But wait, another thought: In some versions of this puzzle, the answer is D, but in this specific wording...

Wait, no, according to the analysis here, it's A.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that C's statement "It's either A or B" is a lie if the culprit is A or B. Wait, no—if the culprit is A, then "it's either A or B" is true.

Wait, unless "either...or" is exclusive. If "either A or B" means exactly one, then if culprit is A, it's still true (since it's A, not both). So no, in this context, it's inclusive or.

I think the analysis holds. So I'll go with A.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, the problem says "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So in the case where A is guilty, C is truthful. So answer is A.

But I just found a similar puzzle online (in my mind) where the answer was D, but maybe not.

Wait, let's suppose that the problem is from a specific source. Wait, no, I shouldn't.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering C's statement.

Wait, C says: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..."

If C is lying, then the culprit is neither A nor B. Which would be C or D.

But in our analysis, if culprit is A, C is truthful.

But let's try to see if there's another way.

Suppose the truth-teller is D.

D says culprit is B or C.

Assume D is truthful, so culprit is B or C.

If culprit is B:

A says B → truthful. But D is supposed to be the only truth-teller. Contradiction.

If culprit is C:

B says C → truthful. Contradiction.

So D cannot be the only truth-teller.

If truth-teller is C: culprit is A or B.

If culprit is A:

All others lie. Works.

If culprit is B:

A also truthful. Doesn't work.

So only culprit A.

If truth-teller is A: culprit B, but then C also truthful. Doesn't work.

Truth-teller B: culprit C, but D also truthful. Doesn't work.

So yes, only possible is C truthful, culprit A.

I think that's solid.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{A}

# Answer

To determine who is responsible for the chickens being stolen, we analyze the statements made by each of the four suspects (A, B, C, D), under the condition that **only one of them is telling the truth**.

---

### Step 1: List of Statements

- **A**: "It's B who's to blame!"
- **B**: "C's the culprit. No doubt about it."
- **C**: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..."
- **D**: "It's B...or C. One of the two!"

We interpret each statement as follows:

- A is claiming **B** is guilty.
- B is claiming **C** is guilty.
- C is claiming the culprit is **either A or B** (inclusive or).
- D is claiming the culprit is **either B or C** (inclusive or).

---

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Case (Who is the Culprit?)

We test each possibility of who the culprit is and count how many people are telling the truth in each scenario.

---

#### ✅ **Case 1: A is the culprit**

- **A**: "It's B" → **False**
- **B**: "C is guilty" → **False**
- **C**: "It's either A or B" → **True** (A is guilty)
- **D**: "It's B or C" → **False**

✅ **Only C is telling the truth** → **This satisfies the condition of exactly one truth-teller.**

---

#### ❌ **Case 2: B is the culprit**

- **A**: "It's B" → **True**
- **B**: "C is guilty" → **False**
- **C**: "It's A or B" → **True**
- **D**: "It's B or C" → **True**

❌ **Three people are telling the truth** → **Invalid**

---

#### ❌ **Case 3: C is the culprit**

- **A**: "It's B" → **False**
- **B**: "C is guilty" → **True**
- **C**: "It's A or B" → **False**
- **D**: "It's B or C" → **True**

❌ **Two people are telling the truth** → **Invalid**

---

#### ❌ **Case 4: D is the culprit**

- **A**: "It's B" → **False**
- **B**: "C is guilty" → **False**
- **C**: "It's A or B" → **False**
- **D**: "It's B or C" → **False**

❌ **No one is telling the truth** → **Invalid**

---

### Step 3: Conclusion

Only **Case 1** (A is the culprit) results in **exactly one person telling the truth** (C). All other cases violate the condition that **only one** of the four is truthful.

Thus, the **only consistent scenario** is that **A is the culprit**, and **C is the only one telling the truth**.

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{A}
$$
