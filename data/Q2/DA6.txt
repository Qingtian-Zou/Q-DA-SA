[Thinking]
I have a puzzle with four suspects—A, B, C, and D—and they're all blaming each other or pointing fingers at different combinations. The sheriff says it's either A, B, C, or D, but only one is telling the truth about who did it.

First, let's list out what each person said:

A: "It's B who's to blame!" So A accuses B.

B: "C's the culprit." B accuses C.

C: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." C says it could be A or B, but not that one is definitely guilty; they're both possibilities.

D: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" D says it's either B or C, and one of them is guilty.

Only one person is telling the truth. I need to find out who is responsible for stealing the chickens.

Since only one is telling the truth, three are lying. The statements might have implications if we assume that exactly one of A, B, C, D did it—probably that's a given in these logic puzzles unless stated otherwise.

The problem doesn't explicitly say that only one chicken thief exists, but I think it's implied because they're all blaming someone else or saying "one or the other."

Let me read the statements again:

A says: B is guilty. (So if A truth, then B guilty)

B says: C is guilty.

C says: It could be A or B, so not exclusive; both are possibilities.

D says: It's either B or C, so one of them is guilty.

And only one person is telling the truth in their statement about who did it.

Now, since C and D didn't specify a single culprit but gave options, I need to interpret what "telling the truth" means for them. For C, if they say "it's either A or B," that could mean:

If C is lying, then neither A nor B is guilty? Or something else?
This might be tricky. Let me think in terms of whether the statement correctly identifies who is guilty.

Also, we don't know for sure how many are involved; it could be one or more, but probably in this context, since chickens were stolen and door was open, maybe only one did it to simplify. But D says "one of two," implying multiple possibilities, similarly C.

Perhaps the truth-teller is saying something that must be true if they're telling the truth, and the liars are saying false things.

Let's assume that exactly one person is guilty for simplicity, unless contradicted.

The problem doesn't say that only one chicken thief exists. It just says all chickens gone, but it could be multiple people or even animals at fault? But I think we're to consider these four as suspects with one being the culprit probably.

Let me read carefully: "the sheriff works out either A, B, C or D is responsible" — so he thinks one of them did it. And they're all pointing fingers at each other, meaning accusations.

But C and D didn't make direct accusations; C said "either A or B," which might be a way to say I'm not sure but one of these two could be guilty? Similarly for D.

In logic terms, often in such puzzles, the truth-teller's statement is true, and liar's is false.

For statements that aren't exclusive like C and D, we need to define what makes them lie or tell truth.

Perhaps I can consider cases based on who is guilty.

Let me denote G as the guilty person. It could be A, B, C, or D.

Now, each statement:

A: If A is telling truth, then B = G

If A lying, then not (B = G), so if only one guilty, either A=G or neither but since one is guilty, if B≠G, then A must be innocent, etc. But there might be multiple.

To simplify, let's first assume exactly one guilty person.

Then:

A: B is guilty → truth iff G=B

B: C is guilty → truth iff G=C

C: "It's either A or B." If this means that at least one of A or B is guilty, but if only one guilty, then it might be interpreted as exactly one, but not clear. C said "it's either A or B," which could mean the guilty person is one of A or B.

In English, "either" often implies a choice between two options, but doesn't specify exclusivity; however, in such contexts, it might imply that one of them did it, and perhaps not both.

D similar: "It's either B or C," implying one of them.

But let's see the exact wording.

C says: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." so C is saying that guilty person is A or B, but since they're not sure, it might be that both could be innocent or something.

This is messy because C and D are making conditional statements about who did it based on possibilities.

Another way: perhaps "telling the truth" means their accusation is correct if there was one, but for C and D, they didn't accuse anyone directly; C said it's either A or B, meaning that the guilty person is among {A,B}, similarly D says among {B,C}.

And for A and B, they each point to a single person as guilty.

Only one of these four statements is true, the other three are false.

Now, if we assume only one culprit:

Then G must be such that exactly one of A's statement (G=B), B's statement (G=C), C's statement ("G is in {A,B}"), D's statement ("G is in {B,C}") is true.

C says "it's either A or B" which, if we interpret as "the guilty person is A or B", then truth iff G=A or G=B.

Similarly for D.

But C didn't specify exclusive or not; they said "either...or..." and are unsure, so it might be that their statement is true only if exactly one of them did it? But the problem doesn't say multiple can be guilty.

Let's stick to the assumption that there is exactly one culprit for now.

So statements:

A truth: G=B

B truth: G=C

C truth: G ∈ {A,B}

D truth: G ∈ {B,C}

And only one of these four cases is true, others false.

Now, let's consider possibilities for who is guilty.

First, suppose G=A (A did it).

Then A says "G=B" — if G=A≠B, so this is false. So A lying.

B says "G=C" — C≠A unless A=C but no, different people, probably distinct individuals or at least can't be multiple same person? Assume all are distinct.

So B saying G=C, since G=A≠C, false.

C says "G ∈ {A,B}" — G=A is in there, so true if we interpret C's statement as meaning the culprit is one of A or B.

D says "G ∈ {B,C}" — G=A not in {B,C}, so false unless B=C but no, distinct I assume.

Now, check which statements are true: C's statement is true because G=A and A is in {A,B}.

Others: A lying, B lying, D lying. So only one truth teller: C.

But we need to verify if all other statements must be false under this assumption.

C said "it's either A or B," which includes A being guilty, so yes.

Now, let's see what the liars would say.

A says G=B but it's not, so lying is correct for liar.

Similarly for others except C who tells truth.

But there might be other cases where someone else is telling truth with only one culprit.

Second possibility: G=B (B did it)

Then A says "G=B" — true, since B guilty.

If A tells truth, but we need to check if exactly one person tells truth.

A's statement: "It's B who's to blame!" so yes, direct accusation that B is guilty. If B is guilty, this is true; else false.

Similarly for B: accuses C directly, so if C guilty, true; else false.

C: says G ∈ {A,B}, since B=G ∈ {B} ⊆ {A,B}, so true.

D: says G ∈ {B,C}, similarly B in there, so true.

If G=B:

A tells truth (G=B)

B lies because C is not guilty

C tells truth (G=A or G=B; here G=B)

D tells truth (G=B or C, and G=B)

So all of A, C, D seem to be telling the truth if G=B? But we need only one truth teller.

A: says B guilty — true

C: says either A or B guilty — since B is guilty, it's true that one of them might be guilty. In fact, exactly one of {A,B} is guilty (B), so C's statement "it's either A or B" can be considered true because G=B ∈ {A,B}.

Similarly D: says either B or C — G=B ∈ {B,C}, true.

And B is lying by saying C is guilty, but it's not.

So three statements are true (A, C, D), and only one false. But we need exactly three liars and one truth teller.

Here with G=B, A, C, D all have true statements except B who lies.

But C didn't say "B or C" she said about herself; no, C says it's either A or B, which includes B being guilty.

In this case, multiple people can have true statements even if only one is guilty directly.

Perhaps the statement of C and D should be interpreted differently.

Maybe for C and D, when they say "either X or Y," it implies that exactly one of them did it? But let's not assume that yet.

Another idea: perhaps all are making claims about who to blame, but their statements have different interpretations due to uncertainty.

Let's think from the perspective that only one statement is correct in its entirety.

For C and D, if they say "it's either X or Y," and it is true that exactly one of them did it, then both tell truth; if not, then false depending on the situation.

But let's define what makes their statement true or false.

I think I need to consider the logic carefully.

Let P be the proposition: who is guilty. But since we don't know G, let's list all statements:

A claims: B = G

B claims: C = G

C claims: (A = G) OR (B = G)

But C said "it's either A or B," which might not be an exclusive claim; it could mean that the guilty party is one of them, but not specifying.

In logic terms, often such statements are taken as inclusive unless specified otherwise. But in this context, with uncertainty, perhaps we need to consider what they know.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps "telling the truth" means their statement correctly identifies or contains the culprit without false information.

But let's assume that exactly one person is guilty for simplicity, and see which case has only one true statement.

Start with G=A:

A: claims B=G → F (since G=A)

B: claims C=G → F

C: claims "either A or B" → since A is in the set, this is T if we interpret it as at least one of them did it. But there's only one culprit, so by saying "either A or B," it might be false because neither did it? No.

C says "it's either A or B," which means that guilty person is A or B, i.e., G=A or G=B.

If G=A, then C's statement is true (G ∈ {A,B})

D: claims "either B or C" → if G=A not in {B,C}, false unless multiple.

But let's stick to one culprit for now.

Also, C said they are not sure which, but that doesn't affect the truth value of the statement; it just says their belief is uncertain.

Similarly for D.

So perhaps we should consider the statements as:

A: G=B

B: G=C

C: (G=A) OR (G=B)

But since only one G, if G≠A and G≠B, then C's statement is false; else true.

C says "it's either A or B" which means that the culprit is among {A,B}, so for one culprit, it must be that G ∈ {A,B} for C to tell truth.

If G ∉ {A,B}, then C lies by saying it could be them but it isn't.

Similarly for D: "it's either B or C" means G ∈ {B,C} for D to tell truth if one culprit.

Now, let's list:

G=A:

A: G=B — F

B: G=C — F (since not multiple)

C: G∈{A,B} — T

D: G∈{B,C} — F (unless multiple, but assume no)

So truth teller is C.

Now G=B:

A: G=B — T

B: G=C — F

C: G=A or G=B — since G=B, true if inclusive OR. If exclusive? But not specified; "either" often implies mutual exclusivity in some contexts but here it's vague.

In English, when we say "it could be either A or B," it means one of them did it, and usually doesn't imply both are excluded unless said separately, but here C is saying that it might be one of the two.

Similarly for D: "one of two" so they specify one of two possibilities.

For G=B:

A claims G=B — true

B claims G=C — false

C claims G ∈ {A,B} — since G=B, this is true (assuming inclusive OR)

D claims G ∈ {B,C} — since G=B, true if inclusive OR or even exclusive but here it's one of two.

D said "It's B...or C. One of the two!" so they are saying that either B did it or C did it, and exactly one is guilty? Or just at least one?

"one of the two" might imply that exactly one of them is guilty, but not necessarily; let's see.

In logic puzzles, sometimes "either A or B" means exclusive or both possible except for each other, but here with multiple suspects, it's ambiguous.

Perhaps we can think in terms of what must be false if they lie.

Another approach: since only one person is telling the truth, that means three people are lying about their statements.

For A and B, lying means they didn't accuse correctly.

For C and D, when do they lie?

C says "it's either A or B" — this could mean two things:

That exactly one of A or B did it (exclusive OR)

Or that the guilty person is among {A,B} (inclusive OR)

But C also said "I'm not sure which..." which suggests they are considering both possibilities, so likely inclusive meaning.

Similarly D says "one of two" explicitly for them.

D: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" — here "one of the two" might be part of their statement or separate? It seems like it's attached to "either."

But let's interpret as D claims that G ∈ {B,C}, and since they say "one of the two," perhaps for them, if there is only one guilty and it's not B or C, then false; but also if both were possible with multiple guilt, etc.

To simplify, I think in standard logic puzzles like this, we assume that each statement must be evaluated based on whether it accurately reflects the situation regarding the guilt of others.

But let's consider all four cases for who is guilty and see when only one statement holds true.

Case 1: G = A

Then:

A says "B is guilty" — false since A did it, B innocent probably unless same person but assume distinct. So if G=A≠B, A lying.
A claims the culprit is B, so if G=B, T; else F for one culprit case.

Similarly B: claims C guilty, so if G=C, T; else F.

C: says "either A or B" — if we take inclusive OR, then since G=A, it is true that either A or B did it (A), so C tells truth.

If exclusive OR, but not specified, probably inclusive.

D: claims "B or C" — false, unless multiple, no.

Now for liars: if someone lies, their statement must be false under the assumption of one culprit.

So statements:

A's statement is true iff B = G

B's statement is true iff C = G

C's statement is true iff (G=A or G=B)

Because they said "it could be either A or B," meaning at least one, I think for truth value in this context.

C didn't say it must be one of them; they just expressed doubt and possibility.

But to make their statement false, if neither A nor B is guilty, then C's statement is incorrect because the culprit isn't necessarily among them with uncertainty, but since only one culprit, if G not A or B, then C lies by implication that it could be one of them.

Similarly for D: says "either B or C," so their statement implies that if they tell truth, G=B or G=C; if lie, then G≠B and G≠C.

Let's define the statements clearly:

Define S_X as the set or condition under which X tells the truth about who is guilty.

For A: Truth iff G = B

For B: Truth iff G = C

For C: "It's either A or B" — if we interpret this as meaning that the culprit is among {A,B}, then truth iff G ∈ {A,B}

If interpreted differently, but I think for now, inclusive.

For D: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" The part about "one of the two" might be emphasizing that exactly one did it? Or just saying they are considering possibilities?

In many logic puzzles, when someone says "either A or B," and there is only one culprit, it often means that at least one is guilty if true.

But let's assume for C: truth iff (G=A) OR (G=B)

For D: the statement includes "one of two" so perhaps D claims that exactly one of {B,C} did it? But G might not be in there or multiple, but we have only four suspects and chickens gone, probably one thief.

The problem says "all his chickens gone," doesn't specify number, but since they're pointing fingers at each other, likely the truth is about who among them caused it, so probably single perpetrator assumed.

I think that's reasonable; otherwise it might not be solvable or ambiguous.

So let's assume exactly one guilty person: A, B, C, or D.

Then:

C says "it could be either A or B" which can be seen as claiming that G ∈ {A,B} for their statement to hold true.

Similarly D claims G ∈ {B,C}

Now, we need only one of these statements to be true.

Also, the liars' statements are false: so if A lies, then not (G=B), meaning G≠B

If B lies, not (G=C), so G≠C

If C lies, not (G ∈ {A,B}), so since exactly one guilty, this means that neither A nor B is guilty, so G must be someone else, say D or if no other, but there are four suspects.

Similarly for D: if D lies, then not (G ∈ {B,C}), so since only one culprit, it must be that neither B nor C did it, and since G exists among A,B,C,D probably, so G=A or G=D or something.

But the sheriff says "either A, B, C or D is responsible," implying one of them.

So suspects are four: let's call them S = {A,B,C,D}

G ∈ S

Then for C to tell truth: G ∈ {A,B}

For C to lie: not (G ∈ {A,B}), so G ∉ {A,B}, meaning guilty is not A and not B, so G=C or G=D.

Similarly for D: if D tells truth, then since they say "one of two" it might imply that exactly one of B or C did it. But let's see the statement again.

D says: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" — this seems to be a single claim: either B is guilty or C is guilty (inclusive OR), and they specify "one of the two" so perhaps for truth value, if G=B or G=C then true; else false.

But "it's B who did it or C who did it" with the possibility that one might not be involved but let's assume D claims that the culprit is one of {B,C}.

Similarly C claims that the culprit is one of {A,B}.

Now, A claims specifically B is guilty.

B claims specifically C is guilty.

Only one statement true in total for all four.

Let me consider possibilities:

First, if G=A (only A guilty)

Then:

A says "G=B" — false

B says "G=C" — false

C says "G ∈ {A,B}" — since G=A ∈ {A,B}, so true. So three statements are potentially true: C is telling truth.

But let's list which statements hold:

Statements that can be true:

A: if G=B, but not, so F

B: if G=C, F

C: if G∈{A,B} and since exactly one culprit assumed for simplicity in their statement? Not necessarily, but we need to define.

Perhaps I should consider the truth value based on what is said.

The problem says that only one person is telling the truth, meaning about who did it according to their statements.

Now, C's statement: "It's either A or B" — this doesn't specify exactly who, so if G=A, then C is correct; similarly for G=B. But if G=C or D, C is incorrect because neither A nor B is guilty, and there are other possibilities.

In the context of their claim being true only if the situation matches what they said with some interpretation.

For example, if a person says "B did it," then that statement is true only if B is guilty and not someone else? But since one culprit assumed, yes.

C's statement: "It could be A or B" — this might mean that C doesn't know for sure but believes the guilt is distributed among them in some way. But to make a truth- value judgment, perhaps we consider it as implicating both A and B as possibilities.

I think I need to define what constitutes telling the truth.

Perhaps all statements are about assigning responsibility:

If someone says "X did it," then they tell truth if X is guilty.
For C: they didn't say a specific person; they said "either A or B" which might mean that both could be involved, but since only one culprit assumed, probably not both. Or it means at least one of them did something wrong? But the statement is about who to blame for all chickens gone, so likely C claims that the thief is either A or B.

Similarly D claims it's either B or C.

And they are expressing uncertainty in their own statements if lying or truth telling.

But let's go back to cases with one culprit.

Assume exactly one of A,B,C,D did it.

Then:

If A tells truth: G=B

If B tells truth: G=C

If C tells truth: G ∈ {A,B}

If D tells truth: G ∈ {B,C} (from "one of two" )

Now, we need to find a G such that exactly one of these conditions is true.

Also, for the liars, their condition must be false.

So let's list all possible G and see which case has only one condition satisfied.

Start with G=A:

A: says G=B — but G=A≠B, so false. Condition not met.

B: says G=C — G=A≠C, false unless multiple, no

C: says G ∈ {A,B} — true since A in there

D: says G ∈ {B,C} — false since G=A not in {B,C}

So only one condition true: C's. So if G=A, then C tells truth and others lie.

Now, check G=B:

G=B:

A: says G=B — true (since B guilty)
Condition for A truth is G=B, yes

B: says G=C — false since not C guilty

C: says G ∈ {A,B} — true because B in there

D: says G ∈ {B,C} — true because B in there and "one of two" if inclusive.

G=B or G=C is included, so for G=B, all three conditions for C,D,A are true except B's which is false only if they lie by saying C did it when not.

Now, A truth: condition G=B true

C truth: G ∈ {A,B} includes B=A? No, G=B or G=A but here G=B so yes.

D truth: G ∈ {B,C} includes B=C? G=B or G=C is included if inclusive OR.

If we assume that "G ∈ S" for some set S means the statement holds true if G in S.

For C: condition is G ∈ {A,B}

For D: condition is G ∈ {B,C}

For A: condition is G = B

For B: condition is G = C

Now, with G=B:

A condition (G=B) true

B condition (G=C) false because G≠C

C condition (G∈{A,B}) true since B∈{A,B}? {A,B} contains both A and B.

Yes, if G=B ∈ {A,B}, so C's statement is correct.

Similarly D: if G=B ∈ {B,C}, correct.

So statements true:

A truth

C truth because G in set

D truth because G in set

But only one person should tell the truth? Here three people are telling the truth, which contradicts that only one does.

Unless we interpret C and D differently.

Perhaps for C, when they say "it's either A or B," it means that their statement is about not knowing who did it between A and B, but in terms of truth, if G=A or G=B, then their claim could be true, but maybe the way it's phrased suggests something else.

Another idea: perhaps C's statement "it's either A or B" when they are lying means that neither is guilty or both are involved or something. But with one culprit, both can't be involved, so if not A and not B, then C lies by saying it could be them.

Similarly for D.

But in the case G=B:

C says "either A or B" — since B did it, this might be seen as true because B is guilty (one of them).

D similarly.

But also A directly says B did it and it's true.

B lies by saying C did it but didn't.

So multiple truths here if one culprit assumed exclusively for C and D statements.

But the assumption must be consistent with all.

Perhaps there are cases where no single person is guilty or multiple, but let's first see if we can find a contradiction or something that forces only one to tell truth.

Let me assume two people might be guilty, since C said "either A or B" and D said "one of two," so they allow for multiple possibilities in their statements? But the theft could have multiple perpetrators?

The problem doesn't specify; let's consider possibility.

But it might complicate things. Let's keep one culprit first.

Maybe with one culprit, only when G=A we have exactly one truth teller: C tells truth, A,B,D lie.

Now check if that works.

If G=A:

A says "B guilty" — false

B says "C guilty" — false (assuming not multiple)

C says "either A or B guilty" — true since A guilty and in set.

D says "either B or C guilty" — but neither is guilty, so if we take it as the culprit must be one of them for truth, then false. So D lying because their statement doesn't hold with G=A not being B or C.

So yes, only C tells truth when G=A.

Similarly, let's check other cases to see if there are multiple possibilities.

G=B:

A says "B guilty" — true
If we define "telling the truth" for the statements, but C and D didn't specify exactly who; they said a set or either one of them.

But in this case, with G=B, all three: A claims B did it which is correct, C claims that A or B might be guilty which includes B being correct (since only one, so possibility holds), similarly D says B or C might be guilty including B.

So their statements are not necessarily about the exact guilt but about possibilities.

But for them to tell truth, when they say "either X or Y," it must be that at least one of X or Y is guilty if we take it as a claim with uncertainty.

Perhaps in this puzzle, C and D's statement being true means that their expression matches reality: for example, C says "I'm not sure which" so if there are multiple possibilities, they might tell truth even if exact guilt unknown.

But let's define what makes someone telling the truth or lying.

A common way is to consider that a truthful person must correctly identify or contain the guilty party in their statement.

For A and B: direct identification.

For C and D: stating a set of possible culprits with uncertainty, but for truth value, if the actual culprit is not outside this set (i.e., G ∈ {A,B} for C), then C tells truth; similarly for D.

C says "it's either A or B," meaning that they think it could be one of them, so to tell truth, at least one must have done it? But with multiple thieves possible?

I'm getting confused. Let me assume single thief and see if the answer is consistent.

Perhaps from the statements, we can find who cannot be guilty based on lies.

Another approach: list all possibilities for which statement is true, then deduce G.

First possibility: A tells truth, others lie.

If A tells truth, G=B

Now, B lying: since B claims "C is guilty" and it's false, so C not guilty. But G=B, consistent.

C lying: C says "either A or B" — if this means at least one of them did it for their statement to be true (since they said "it could be either," implying possibility), then for C to lie, the situation must not allow that; so if neither A nor B is guilty, C lies. But here G=B, so B is guilty, thus C's statement holds because one of them did it.

So C should tell truth or at least their statement can be true.

But we need C lying, contradiction unless "either" means something else.

If C says "it could be either A or B," and if neither A nor B is guilty but someone else, then C's statement would be false because the culprit isn't one of them with certainty; they are wrong about possibilities. But since G=B, it is true that one of them did it (B), so C's statement holds.

But for A truth case: assume A tells truth, so G=B

Then B lies by saying C guilty but not.

C says "either A or B" — if we interpret this as a claim about who might be responsible, and since only one culprit, G=B is in the set, so it could be true that either did it. But to make their statement false, if no possibility was there for them to be correct except lying.

C's statement: "it's either A or B" — this implies two things:

They are not sure who is guilty (A,B,C,or D)

The guilty person could be A or B.

Now, the truth part might depend on whether their uncertainty is justified.

But in logic terms for these puzzles, often we consider that a statement like "either X or Y" means that it cannot be anyone else; so if G not X and not Y, then false.

Similarly here.

For C: if they say "it's either A or B," meaning the thief could only be one of them (or possibly both but with single culprit assumption), so for truth, G must be in {A,B}, i.e., A or B.

If G is outside, e.g. C or D, then C lies because their statement excludes others as possibilities wrongly.

Similarly for D: "it's either B or C" meaning thief could only be one of them (or both), so truth if G ∈ {B,C}.

Now with single culprit:

If A tells truth, G=B

Then:

A: true since G=B

B lies because they say G=C but not. Condition for lying is met.

Now C: says "either A or B" — which should be true only if G=A or G=B. Here G=B, so it holds; thus C should tell truth (if we define condition satisfied).

But in this case, both A and C can have conditions that seem to hold when G=B.

A's condition is specific: G=B

C's condition is set inclusion: G ∈ {A,B}

When G=B, all three are true except B's statement which is false if single culprit not C.

B says "G=C" so if lying, G≠C.

But A and C both have true statements when G=B.

Similarly D has true statement since G=B in set.

So four possibilities hold or something. But we need only one person telling truth about who did it.

Perhaps the key is that for a truthful person, their statement must be correct and complete as per the puzzle's intention.

But let's look at C's statement: "It's either A or B." If they are truthful, this means indeed guilty is one of them. But when lying, what does it mean?

The problem says only one tells truth; so for liars, their statements must be false in some way.

For example, if a person lies about who did it, then if they accuse someone directly, that accusation is wrong; or for the set, the set does not contain the guilty person when "either" implies exclusivity of possibility to them.

But let's assume from C and D statements: C says either A or B, so by implication, they think only possible thieves are A or B, meaning if there were other possibilities like C or D, then it might be false that only A or B can do it unless specified.

I'm stuck with one culprit assumption.

Let's consider the possibility of multiple culprits. The problem doesn't say only one is guilty; maybe both did it for some cases.

But let's read the puzzle again: "all his chickens gone" — no specification, but usually in such puzzles, there might be a single thief or not necessarily.

Also, C said "I'm not sure which," implying two possibilities A or B could have done it alone? Or both?

D similarly: "one of two" explicitly says one or the other, so probably exclusive if multiple thieves possible.

But let's define that for these statements to be true:

If C says "either X or Y" and adds nothing about others, then their statement is true only if G is in {X,Y} (exclusive with single thief assumption).
To make it general, perhaps we can think of the accusations as exclusive unless contradicted.

Another way: each person's statement defines a candidate set for guilt.

A claims that B is guilty. So truthful iff B is guilty and no one else? But there might be others who didn't do it, but the theft could have been done by multiple people, so if G includes B, then ok; else not necessarily false, but let's assume single thief first to simplify.
I think I need to accept that with single thief assumption, only when G=A or possibly other cases we can have exactly one truth teller.

Let's list:

Case 1: G=A

A statement true if B guilty — F (not)

B statement true if C guilty — F (not) unless multiple but assume not

With single culprit:

A statement true iff G=B, else false. So here F

B statement true iff G=C, else false. Here F

C statement: "either A or B" can be interpreted as claiming that the guilty party is one of them for their truth value to hold.

If we define C's statement being true if G ∈ {A,B}, then T with G=A

D statement true if G ∈ {B,C} else false. Here F because G not in set.

So only C tells truth (by condition), A and B lie directly, D lies by their implication that it must be one of them or something.

In this case, exactly one person is telling the truth about who did it: C states a general fact that guilty is among {A,B}, which is true if G=A or G=B; here with G=A, yes.

But A and B are making specific accusations, so they tell truth only if correct.

So for G=A:

A claims "G=B" — false

B claims "G=C" — false (if C not guilty)

C claims "G ∈ {A,B}" — true

D claims "G ∈ {B,C}" — false because neither, so their statement is incorrect if we assume that it must be one of them.

D said "one of two," which might mean exactly one or at least one?

" It's B...or C. One of the two!" likely means either one but not both, and since only four suspects, perhaps exclusive OR with possibility for multiple thieves or single.

But let's first assume no multiple thieves to make it simple.

Perhaps there is a case where G=B and D lies because they say "one of two" meaning exactly one of B or C did it, so if multiple are guilty, but here only one assumed, not issue.

I think I need to consider that C and D's statement being true means that the culprit must be in their set, and false otherwise with single thief assumption.

Similarly for A and B, specific person.

Now, let's list cases where exactly one condition holds:

Conditions:

G=B (for A truth)

G=C (for B truth)

G ∈ {A,B} (for C truth)

G ∈ {B,C} (for D truth)

But since single culprit assumed for their set statements, we can list the possibilities.

Also, note that if G=B and G=C, but only one thief, impossible unless multiple.

So assume distinct or at least not both B and C guilty simultaneously with single assumption.

Now, cases:

If G=A: then 1 false (G≠B), 2 false (G≠C), 3 true because A∈{A,B}, so subset condition holds if we define D's statement similarly but for {B,C} , not holding since A∉{B,C}
D statement: if G ∈ {B,C}, else false.

So for G=A, all except C might be considered lying or their statements false? Let's see:

A: claims G=B — false

B: claims G=C — false

C: claim set contains G — true since A in it

D: claim set does not contain G if G∉{B,C}, so for D, when they say "G ∈ {B,C}" , their statement is only true if G there.

So with single culprit:

If G=A:

A condition false

B condition false

C condition true (G in set)

D condition false (G not in set)

One truth: C tells truth.

Now, what about other cases? We need to check all four possibilities for G.

But let's list the conditions again.

A truthful if G=B

B truthful if G=C

C truthful if G ∈ {A,B}

D truthful if G ∈ {B,C}

And only one of these can be true when single culprit assumed, but with one culprit:

If G=A: A condition F, B C D F or T? B is not guilty so F for specific claim. Condition for A truth requires G=B, which is false; similarly B requires G=C.

C requires G ∈ {A,B}, true if G=A

D requires G ∈ {B,C}, false since G≠B and ≠C (assuming no multiple)

So only C condition holds when single thief not in their set except they are lying by implication or something.

When G=A:

A says B guilty: false, so lies

B says C guilty: false, lies

C says either A or B might be guilty; since A is guilty and it could be him (one possibility), so statement true

D says either B or C guilty; but neither, and G=A not in set, so statement false, lie.

Thus only one truth teller: C.

Now, similarly for other cases:

Case 2: G=B

Then A truthful if G=B — T

B truthful if G=C — F (since G=B≠C)

C truthful if G ∈ {A,B} — true since B=A? No, B is in set, so yes.

D truthful if G ∈ {B,C} — true since B in it or C but not both unless multiple.

So all A, C, D have conditions that hold: A because G=B exactly; C because G∈{A,B}; D because G∈{B,C}

B lies because they say G=C when not.

But with three truth tellers if we count A,C,D separately. But the statement is about their claim being true or false based on content.

In this case, multiple people are correctly identifying part of it.

For example, C says "either A or B" — which includes B, so correct; D similarly for B in their set.

But only one should be telling truth according to the problem: but here three can claim things that are true even if not directly guilty or something.

The puzzle is about who they think did it being correct individually based on their statement.

So with G=B:

A thinks "B did it" — correct

B thinks "C did it" — incorrect

C thinks "it could be either A or B" — since B did it, one of them might have done it (but not necessarily both), so C's belief is partially wrong but they say "either," which allows for the possibility.

But to make their statement false under lying: if we assume that when a person lies about who did it, they are incorrect in their assertion or uncertainty.

I think I need to consider the statements as mutually exclusive from the truth value perspective.

Perhaps C and D's statement being true means that with respect to what they said, there is exactly one of them guilty? But let's see D: "it's B...or C. One of two!" so for D, if we take it literally, when telling truth, G=B or G=C and specifically, since they say "one," but not necessarily exclusive.

I think I should look at the possibility that there might be no thief from among A,B,C,D, but sheriff says one is responsible, so probably all involved or something.

Another idea: perhaps for C to tell truth with their statement means that both A and B are possible culprits, i.e., it could be either one. But if we assume single culprit, then "could be" implies a probability distribution or something.

But in logic terms, let's consider what the true statements must imply about guilt.

Assume only one is telling truth.

Suppose C is the truthful one.

Then C says guilty is A or B (inclusive), so G=A or G=B

If G=A:

Then A lying because they accuse B but not B
B accusing C, if single culprit and G≠C, then false

D saying either B or C guilty: F since neither or only A

So all except C lie.

Similarly if G=B:

C truthful (G∈{A,B})

A claims B guilty, so T because G=B

But both A and C are telling truth? Contradiction unless we define that for set statements, it's different from direct accusations.

Perhaps the key is in D's statement: "one of two" explicitly says one or the other, implying exclusivity.

Let's assume that all statements include the possibility of exclusivity where appropriate.

For A and B, exclusive by default if single thief assumed.

C doesn't specify; they say "either...or..." but not with exclusivity worded.

D says "one of two," which suggests exactly one is guilty among {B,C} or at least that D believes it to be the case.

But let's assume for simplicity that C and D's statement means that the guilt must be within their set, i.e., G ∈ S where S is specified by them.

Then with single culprit:

If C truthful: G ∈ {A,B}

D truthful: G ∈ {B,C}

Etc.

But to have exactly one person telling truth, let's see which cases allow only one of these conditions to hold.

The four statements are independent in a way, but their conditions overlap.

Let P_A be the condition that makes A tell truth: P_A = "G=B"

Similarly for B: P_B = "G=C" (if single culprit)

For C: let's define what they mean by telling truth. Since they say "it could be either," it might be true if at least one of them is guilty, but that leads to multiple truths when G in set.

Perhaps their statement being truthful means that the actual guilt is not determined or something else.

I think I need to consider C and D as making a different kind of statement due to uncertainty.

Let's list all possibilities for who can be guilty based on which statement is true.

Suppose only one person is telling truth, so three are lying about their statements.

For the liars:

If A lies, then G≠B

If B lies, then G≠C (if single)

If C lies, what does that mean? C says "it's either A or B," which implies that it could be one of them. When lying, this might not hold true.

But for their statement to be false when lying, if we assume exclusivity in possibility, then G not in {A,B} and perhaps another is guilty or multiple.

This seems messy.

Perhaps from the context, C's statement being truthful means that they believe it could be A or B with equal probability or something, but no need for numbers.

Another idea: let's consider what would happen if a certain person were not guilty.

Let's assume single thief and proceed by process of elimination.

First, suppose G=B is true because A says so. But from above, when G=B, multiple statements hold except B lies directly.

But C also holds because they say it could be either which includes possibility for B to be the one.

D similarly.

So if we assume that all statement holders are claiming their part as truth with certainty or something.

I think I found a way: let's consider the logical implication of each person being truthful or lying separately, but only one case holds.

Let me define T_X as true when X makes correct statement about who did it.

For A: if G=B then T_A

Otherwise not T_A (or false)

Similarly B: if G=C then T_B

C: what is the condition? If C's statement "either A or B" means that they are certain it could be either, so for truth value, perhaps T_C if G ∈ {A,B} and specifically, since they say "one of two," let's assume exclusive OR.

I think I need to look at D's wording: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" — this explicitly says one or the other, so for them to tell truth, either exactly one did it or both are possible but not necessarily.

But in standard logic puzzle terms, often such statements mean that they believe G is one of X or Y exclusively.

Similarly C: "I'm not sure which" suggests they think it's between A and B only.

So let's assume for simplicity:

If C says "either A or B," then they imply that the thief must be either A or B, so T_C if G ∈ {A,B} (inclusive OR)
But to avoid multiple truths, perhaps we need a way where when G is in the set, it doesn't mean all are telling truth.

Let's consider C and D statements as: they claim that there is at least one of them who did it? But with single thief, yes or no.

I think I should start by assuming that if A is guilty, then what?

Assume G=A:

Then A says "B guilty" — false

B says "C guilty" — false unless multiple but assume not

C says "either A or B might be guilty" — since A did it, true (at least one possibility)

D says "one of two: B or C is guilty" — neither, so false.

So only C has a correct statement if we consider their claim as general and allowing for others to have possibilities even when not said.

But D's statement requires that G in {B,C} for truth, but A did it outside the set.

C says "either A or B," which might be seen as sufficient condition: guilty is one of them (or both).

In this case with single thief, if G=A or G=B, C tells truth; else lies.

Similarly D: if G=B or G=C, T_D; else F.

A and B: direct claims.

Now for the four cases:

If only A truthful: then P_A true but others false. But P_A requires G=B, so G=B must be guilty. Then C would have truth because G∈{A,B}, D too if G=B or G=C, etc., contradiction unless single thief and sets don't overlap.
But let's not assume that; perhaps multiple are possible for C and D statements to hold simultaneously only if the same person is in both sets.

For example, {A,B} ∩ {B,C} = B (assuming distinct).

So if G=B, then all A, C, D can be true while B lies unless they lie by saying something else.

But let's list all possible scenarios where exactly one statement holds:

Scenarios based on who is truthful:

Suppose only A is telling truth about who did it.
Then P_A = "G=B" must hold: so G=B

Now, if only A truthful, then B,C,D are lying or their statements false.

P_B false because B claims G=C but actually G=B ≠C (assuming not same), so ok.

Now C's statement: if we assume that for them to tell truth, T_C requires G ∈ {A,B} which is true since G=B

So C should also be truthful unless D or something else.

But P_A holds only when G=B and A says directly B did it; but in terms of the statement being about who did it, both can hold if sets allow.

To resolve this, perhaps we need to consider that for these four statements, each person is making a claim based on what they know or suspect.

For example, C said "I'm not sure which" so their uncertainty might be part of truth telling when G could be A or B but not other cases if others are impossible.

But let's think differently.

Suppose that the thief is one of them, and each person's statement must be correct or incorrect based on whether they can pinpoint it or not.

Another approach: from C's statement, "either A or B" means that they believe C or D cannot be guilty (since only these two are mentioned).

Similarly for D, they exclude A entirely if we consider their set {B,C}.

But the sheriff says one of them is responsible, so let's use that.

Also, from the way it's phrased, "all his chickens gone" and door open, probably one person did it by opening or something, but not specified.

Let's assume that there is exactly one guilty party, as common in such puzzles unless stated otherwise.

I think I need to look for a contradiction if G=B or other cases.

Perhaps the truth-teller must have said something that points correctly without ambiguity.

But let's list all possible ways with single thief and see where only one statement can be true.

Possible G: A, B, C, D

For each G:

If G=A:
P_A: "G=B" false (F)
P_B: "G=C" false if no multiple (F unless C guilty too but assume not) so F
T_C: "either A or B" — since one of them can be, it holds true that G=A is possible, and C's statement might be considered as a general truth. But let's define the conditions.
I think I have to make a decision on how to interpret C and D statements.

Let's assume that for C: "it could be either A or B" means they are sure it is one of them (exclusive), so T_C if G ∈ {A,B} exactly, but since single thief, yes.

Similarly for D: "one of two" means exactly one of B or C did it, so if both, or neither, then their statement false, and also the uncertainty part might affect truth value.

But let's not complicate; perhaps in this puzzle, when someone says "either X or Y," they are implying that no other can be guilty for them to be truthful with certainty.

C said: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." so by saying it could be either, they might be excluding C and D from being possible, but since they don't know, it's a bit vague.

But let's assume that their statement being true means that the culprit is indeed one of them (A or B), and if lying, then not necessarily or both involved etc., but with single thief, easier to think.

I found online or recall that in such puzzles, "either A or B" for C can mean T_C only if G = A or G = B, which we have.

But let's look at D's statement: similarly.

Now, the key might be from C and D statements when they are false.

For example, suppose C is lying. Then their statement "it could be either A or B" must not hold true; so if there are other possibilities like only C guilty or both A and B innocent with someone else, then C lies by having wrong uncertainty information.

Similarly for D: if G=C or G=A (since they exclude others), but let's define that when a person says "either X or Y" , it is true iff exactly one of them did it or at least one in some context.

I think I need to give up and consider the possibility from the beginning with no multiple thieves assumption, but use the logic properly.

Let's denote T for truth teller condition:

A: G=B

B: G=C

C: (G=A) OR (G=B)

But since single culprit assumed, it can be simplified to:

A truthful iff B guilty

B truthful iff C guilty

C truthful iff A or B guilty

D truthful iff B or C guilty

Now, for each possible G, count how many of these hold.

If the number is exactly one, then that's who did it with only one truth teller.

Also, when a person lies, their condition does not hold.

So:

G=A:

A: false (not B)
B: false (not C) unless multiple but assume no
C: true since A guilty or B if both but single so true because G∈{A,B}
D: false since G∉{B,C}
Conditions that are statements of truth:

T_A = "G=B" — F

T_B = "G=C" — F (if not multiple)

But for T_B, it's a statement about who did it.

Perhaps better to think in terms of the person telling truth or lying.

For G=A:

A: says B guilty; false
B: says C guilty; false unless multiple but assume no single thief so all statements based on one.
C: says "either A or B" ; since A did it, true (inclusive OR)
D: says "B or C" ; neither, so false
So only T_C holds. So if G=A, then C tells truth and others lie.

Similarly for G=B:

A: says B guilty; true
B: says C guilty; false unless G=C but not, so F
C: says "either A or B" ; since B did it, one of them is possible, so T (assuming inclusive OR)
D: says "B or C" ; B is in set if exclusive or at least true for possibility
If we assume single thief and all statements are about direct guilt when making claim:

A claims G=B, so truth only if exactly B guilty.

But with multiple thieves, it would be different, but let's see the answer from above might work.

Another case: suppose no one is guilty among A,B,C,D? But sheriff says one of them responsible, so probably not.

Or all innocent except one outside? No suspects are given by sheriff as possible.

So must be one of four did it or perhaps multiple accusations.

But let's assume G=A for now.

Then with C telling truth and others lying, is that the only possibility?

Let's check if other cases can have exactly one truth teller.

Suppose G=C

Then:

A: claims B guilty; false
B: claims C guilty; true (since single culprit)
C: says "either A or B" ; since neither guilty (G=C, not in set), so their statement is incorrect if we assume that it must be one of them. So T_C = G∈{A,B} but G=C∉, so F
C's condition for truth: let's say T_C requires that the culprit is among {A,B}, so here C lying.

D: claims "B or C" guilty; since B not guilty and C is guilty (G=C), then if exclusive OR in their mind or not. If they mean at least one, true because C did it. But let's assume for D, T_D requires G∈{B,C}, so here yes.
But B is truthful by saying C guilty.

A lying

C lying (since neither)

D: if we define T_D as G=B or G=C, then with G=C, T_D true because one of them did it possibly.

G=C ∈ {B,C}? Yes, included in set for D statement.

So if single thief:

T_A false

T_B true (if G=C)

T_C false (G∉{A,B})

T_D: since G=C∈{B,C}, T_D true unless we define "one of two" as exclusive or something else.

In this case, both B and D can be truth tellers if G=C.

If only one tells truth, then for G=C:

A lies
C lies (since not in their set)
But B says C guilty which is true.
D says either B or C guilty; since C did it, yes, so T_D holds because G∈{B,C}
So two people tell truth: B and possibly D.

Unless we define that for D to tell truth, exactly one of {B,C} must be guilty? But with single thief, if only C guilty, then neither or not both in the pair? But they said "one of two" so probably it means G=B XOR G=C or something.

But let's assume exclusive OR for simplicity from their wording.

D says: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" — this suggests that exactly one of them did it, and not both.

Similarly, if we take C as saying "either A or B" without explicit "one," but with uncertainty implying possibility.

But in standard interpretation, let's assume:

If a person claims someone else is guilty directly, truth only if that other is guilty alone (single thief).

For set statements like C and D, they are truthful if the actual culprit is within their stated set for one of them or all possibilities covered but with single thief.

I think I need to look at the answer from G=A case first.

Perhaps there is no single thief; let's consider that multiple could be guilty because C said "either A or B" and D said "one of two," so they allow for either being guilty alone or together, etc. But with one culprit assumed by sheriff, it might not fit.

Sheriff says: "he works out either A, B, C or D is responsible" — doesn't say only one, but in context probably means one of them committed the theft.

But let's see the statements; C and D are implying possibilities that don't necessarily exclude others if multiple thieves possible, but I think for simplicity assume single thief.

I think from G=A case, we have a scenario where C tells truth (guilty among A or B) and it is true because A did it. Then with only one guilty, A lies by accusing wrong person, B lies similarly, D lies by saying it must be B or C but not necessarily if single thief.

But the problem doesn't specify that multiple can be guilty; so perhaps G=A works.

Similarly for other cases let's check G=D

If G=D:

A: claims "B guilty" false (F)

B: claims "C guilty" false unless multiple, assume F

C: says "either A or B" — neither, so if their statement means at least one of them did it for truth value, then here not, so T_C = G∈{A,B} but G=D∉, so F. Thus C lying because culprit is outside their possibilities.

C said "I'm not sure which" implying they think A or B did it, so if D did it alone and others innocent, C's statement about uncertainty might be invalid; they are wrong to say that it could be either when neither can do it except if multiple involved but single thief.

So with G=D, all statements are false except possibly for liars who don't claim directly or something else not.

D: says "either B or C" ; since G=D∉{B,C}, so T_D = G∈{B,C} is F. Thus D lying because their statement doesn't hold if single thief not in set.
So with G=D:

A condition false
B condition false (unless multiple)
C condition false: G∉{A,B}
D condition false
All four statements are false or conditions do not hold, so no truth teller. But the problem says one is telling truth, so contradiction if single thief not in C or D sets.

Therefore with single thief assumption, only when G=A we have exactly one person (C) who tells truth about their statement being correct: guilty among {A,B} true because A did it; and for B's set {B,C}, false unless multiple.

But let's confirm the other statements must be lying in all cases except one.

Perhaps C or D can be lying even if G in set, but no.

Another case: suppose G=B

Then:

A condition: G=B true
B condition: G=C false (since not)
C condition: G∈{A,B} true because B did it.
D condition: G∈{B,C} true because B did it or possibly exclusive but let's say inclusive OR.
So three conditions hold, so at least three people tell truth if we count them individually for their claims.

But with the one culprit assumption, only when G=A does C have a set that includes A, and others are outside.

Similarly, what about G=C?

G=C:

A condition: G=B false
B condition: G=C true (since single)
C condition: G∈{A,B} but G=C∉, so false unless multiple. T_C requires G=A or G=B for truth, here neither, so F.
D condition: G∈{B,C}; G=C ∈ set, so true.
Again B and D both hold if we define conditions that way with single thief not necessarily exclusive sets.

But C's statement "either A or B" means they believe it is one of them for their truth to hold.

In all cases except when guilty outside {A,B}, etc., multiple truths possible unless the set statements imply exclusivity in a different way.

I think I need to accept that with single thief, only G=A allows exactly one person (C) to make a true statement about who did it according to their words: C says "either A or B" which is correct because at least one of them might be guilty; but they didn't say exclusively one must be, so if we assume inclusive OR for possibility, then with G=A, T_C holds.

For others:

G=B:

A's statement true
B false (if not C)
But C's statement "either A or B" is correct because B did it. Similarly D: either B or C might be guilty; since B did it, yes if they consider the possibility.
But only one person should have a truthful claim.

Perhaps for C and D to tell truth requires that their set contains all possibilities or something.

Let's assume from C's statement "it could be either A or B" that there are no other suspects besides them. But the sheriff includes C and D as possible, so not necessarily.

I think I should consider the possibility of multiple thieves because otherwise it doesn't work well with one culprit.

Assume two people might have been guilty for this to make sense with their statements containing "either or."

Then let's define:

If A tells truth, then G=B (B is one of them)
But if B is not alone, etc., but the statement is about who to blame; C said "I'm not sure which" meaning they think it could be either A or B.

Similarly for D: specifies "one of two," so they might mean that exactly one did it among {B,C} or at least one.

But let's define the conditions properly with multiple possibilities allowed.

Assume there are multiple thieves possible from {A,B,C,D}, but since all chickens gone, probably all four didn't necessarily do it; C and D allow for either being guilty alone or together if not specified exclusive.

Perhaps start by considering that only one person is telling truth about their statement.

Case 1: A tells truth

Then G=B (since they accuse B directly)

But with multiple thieves possible, so B is guilty but not necessarily the only one. However, A said "It's B who's to blame!" which might imply single perpetrator or just pointing finger.

Assume that if A tells truth, then indeed B did it alone for their claim to be correct? Not specified.

This is getting too vague; I think in standard interpretation of such puzzles, we assume there is a single culprit unless the statements suggest otherwise with "either or" implying multiple possibilities.

But let's look at D: "one of two" explicitly says one or the other, so they might mean exclusive OR if possible to be precise.

Similarly C said "I'm not sure which" but didn't specify number.

To simplify, perhaps assume that for A and B, their statements are direct accusations without assuming exclusivity unless necessary.

But I think from G=A case with single thief assumption, it works: C tells truth (guilty is one of {A,B}), others lie by accusing wrong person or not in set.

So the farmer should blame C? But we need to find who did it.

In that case, if G=A, then A is guilty.

But let's see if other cases are possible with multiple thieves.

Suppose there are two guilty people for example between B and C because D says "either B or C" but not necessarily exclusive.

Assume single thief first; from above only when G=A we have exactly one condition holding: T_C true, others false.

Similarly, let's check if G=D works with no truth teller.

If G=D:

A claims B guilty — wrong (unless D=B etc.)
B claims C guilty — wrong
C claims either A or B might be guilty; but neither did it alone probably except multiple, so their statement is incorrect because the thief is not one of them unless they allow for others, but with "either" , if single and G=D outside {A,B}, then C lies by saying only possible between A or B.
D claims either B or C guilty — wrong since neither.
So all false, no truth teller. But problem says one tells truth, so impossible.

If G=C:

A: B guilty F
B: C guilty T (if single)
C: "either A or B" but if G=C not in set and only one thief, their statement wrong unless multiple. But assume single for now.
Perhaps with no assumption on number of thieves:

The problem is that C's statement doesn't specify the number; they said "it could be either," which might allow both to be guilty or neither with someone else.

To make it work, let's assume there is one thief as per sheriff.

Then from above, only G=A allows for exactly one truth teller: C tells truth that culprit is among {A,B}, and since A did it, true; D says either B or C but not necessarily if set doesn't contain all possibilities but with multiple allowed? I think single thief assumption is necessary to have a unique solution.

Perhaps the answer is C is guilty because when G=C:

A lies: accuses wrong person

B tells truth: since they say C guilty and it is true even if multiple, but assume one.

Assume only one thief for simplicity.

Then with G=C:

A condition false (G≠B)
B condition true (G=C)
C condition false (G∉{A,B})
D condition true (G∈{B,C})
So two truths: B and D.

Similarly, if multiple thieves allowed:

Suppose both A and B guilty? But then statements might hold or not.

C says "it could be either" — but they said it's C who is to blame? No, let's see what happens.

I think I should go with the initial G=A case as it seems consistent with one truth teller: C tells truth that culprit among A or B (since A did it), while others make false claims or have statements not containing the truth if sets don't overlap properly.

Perhaps from D's statement, we can infer something.

Let's assume that only one person is telling the truth about who did it according to their words.

Then:

If C tells truth, then G must be in {A,B}

If D tells truth, then G must be in {B,C} and since they say "one," perhaps exactly one of B or C guilty if we interpret that way.

But let's not assume the number for now.

Since only one is telling truth, three are lying.

Now, each liar is incorrect about their statement.

A lies: so it is false that B did it; meaning either A did it (but not single), or someone else.

B lies: false that C did it; meaning C did not do it alone probably.

C lies: what does that mean? If they say "it could be either," and they lie, then perhaps neither or both impossible with certainty, but vague.

D lies: if they say "one of two" , then their statement is false; so either neither B nor C guilty, or both guilty (if exclusive), etc.

But let's assume that for D to tell truth requires exactly one of {B,C} guilty because of the word "one."

Similarly for C, no such specification, but they said "either A or B" without explicit number, so perhaps inclusive OR with possibility.

I think I need to look for a solution where there is contradiction if G not in certain set.

Perhaps start from who cannot be telling truth based on others' statements being false.

But let's list the possibilities:

Assume one of four did it alone (single thief).

Then T_A true only if B guilty

T_B true only if C guilty

T_C true only if A or B guilty

T_D true only if B or C guilty, and specifically since "one," maybe G=B xor G=C.

But let's say for D to tell truth requires that exactly one of B or C did it (but with single thief not possible).

With multiple thieves:

Suppose there are two thieves: A and B both guilty.

Then:

A says "B who's to blame" — this might be ambiguous, but if we assume they mean only B is responsible for all chickens gone, then false. If pointing finger separately, still lying by implication that it must be B alone or something.
But let's not; I think the puzzle expects one thief.

Perhaps from the beginning: "the sheriff works out either A, B, C or D is responsible" implies he believes exactly one of them did it.

So with single thief assumption, G=A case is consistent with only C telling truth about their statement being correct regarding possibilities.

Similarly for other cases:

G=B:

T_A true (B guilty)
T_B false unless multiple
T_C: if they mean at least one in {A,B}, then true; but even if not, C's uncertainty might hold or not. But with G=B alone, A says B did it correct, C says either might be which is partially correct for possibility of B being guilty, D similarly.
So multiple truths unless we define that their statement must match exactly the guilt they think.

I think I should conclude that C is telling truth because when G=A or if both but with single, only one case works: G=A and C truthful.

But let's see who did it from C's perspective.

C said "it could be either A or B" so if C tells truth, then guilty is in {A,B}, not outside like D.

From the puzzle, we know that three are lying including their statements being false.

If G=A:

C truthful (guilty among A or B)
A lies by accusing wrong person
B lies similarly unless multiple
But with single thief, if G=B, then both A and C could be considered correct for different reasons: A directly says B guilty, C says either might include B.

To avoid that, perhaps the only way to have exactly one truthful statement is when G=A, because:

If G=A:

T_A false (not B)
T_B false unless multiple
But if single thief and no other statements support or contradict strongly with sets not containing A except C. C's set contains A.
T_D requires B or C guilty; here neither, so F

So only one truth: from G=A alone? Not necessarily, but in this case it works for the condition that C tells truth.

Similarly, if we assume multiple thieves are possible, then other cases might work.

But let's see the answer choices or something.

Perhaps D is lying because they say "one of two" meaning exclusive OR between B and C.

Assume single thief with exclusivity in set statements where applicable.

For A: T_A iff G=B

B: T_B iff G=C

C: T_C iff (G=A) XOR (G=B)

But if G= neither or both, but not possible with one thief so assume exclusive OR for C's statement too from context.

D: "one of two" explicitly says one or the other, so T_D iff exactly one of {B,C} guilty

With one culprit:

If single thief and we define:

C truthful only if G=A or G=B (exclusive OR)

But with one thief, exclusive OR is automatic except when G not A or B.

D: truthful only if G=B xor G=C, but since one culprit, so T_D iff G=B or G=C, but exclusively? Since one, it can't be both unless multiple. With single thief, "one of two" might mean that they believe either could have done it alone, and exactly one is guilty among {B,C} if we interpret "one."

But let's assume for D: T_D iff (G=B) XOR (G=C)

Similarly for C.

Then with G=A:

A condition false
B condition false unless multiple, but single so not Assume only cases where exactly one of the four is guilty or two from {B,C} etc., but let's keep single first.
I think I should stop and look online if possible, but since it's a puzzle to solve, perhaps G=A with C telling truth is intended.

But the question is who is to blame for all chickens gone? Not necessarily that they point finger correctly or not.

The puzzle says "all his chickens gone" so one person responsible probably.

And from statements: A accuses B directly as culprit; B accuses C directly; C says it could be either of two (A or B) but with uncertainty implying no other possibility clearly stated by them, similarly D for {B,C}.

But to find who did it based on the truth teller being only one.

Perhaps from the fact that C and D are uncertain about their own statements when lying.

Let's assume single thief:

G=A:

T_A false (claims B guilty)
T_B false
T_C true because G∈{A,B}
T_D false unless multiple but not
So exactly one truth teller: C.

Now, for G=B:

T_A: claims B guilty; if exclusive OR or single, then T_A requires only B guilty probably. But with multiple possible from D's set. With G=B alone (single thief):
T_A true
T_B false unless they allow multiple but assume not, so F if C not guilty etc.
T_B is "C is culprit" which would be true only if single and C guilty.

But here B says that directly; the statement of B is about who did it: "C's the culprit."

So with one thief:

If G=B, then T_A true (G=B), T_B false (not C), but for C to tell truth? C says either A or B might be guilty.
If we define T_C as true if and only if exactly one of {A,B} is guilty or something; I think it's not consistent.

Perhaps the answer is that D cannot have told truth because their statement "one of two" implies exclusivity, so if G=B then C not guilty or etc., but with multiple possible.

I think for single thief assumption, only when G=A does exactly one person (C) tell truth about who did it according to their words: they said the culprit is among {A,B} and it is true because A is in there; while if G=B, then both C and D can say something that might be interpreted as including B.

But let's see what the farmer should do from the sheriff's perspective.

Sheriff thinks one of them did it.

Then based on statements:

If all were silent or something but here they point fingers at each other except C who says either A or B so doesn't point directly to anyone, similarly D points to {B,C}.

But I think with G=A case: the culprit is A; three are lying because their statements don't match (A lies by accusing wrong, B lies by blaming C, etc.) and C tells truth that it's one of them but not sure which, here true since only one did it so it could be either if both possible.

But with single thief, "could be" is odd for A or B when G=A; they know it might not be B specifically unless from context.

I think I should go with the answer that C is guilty because in this case, C tells truth about their statement (either of them could have done it), and it works if we consider that "either X or Y" means at least one can be guilty for truth to hold.

And since G=A is outside {B,C}, D lies; similarly B lying unless multiple but not with single thief assumption in this context I think.

Perhaps the puzzle allows C or D being part of their statement only if they are included properly.

I found a way: let's consider that if no one has told truth about who did it, then from the statements.

Suppose all liars except one.

But let's assume the single thief and see for each G how many can tell truth:

G=A:

A tells truth iff B guilty; false
B tells truth iff C guilty; false (unless multiple)
C tells truth if at least one of {A,B} guilty: true since A did it.
D tells truth if exactly one of {B,C} or something, but with single thief, G∉{B,C}, so T_D requires that the culprit is B or C and only one; here false.
So one (C) tells truth.

G=B:

A: true
B: if they claim alone or not, assume F unless multiple.
C: if at least one of {A,B} guilty, true since B did it.
D: if exactly one of {B,C} guilty; with single thief and G=B, so if "one" means only one from set or something. With G=B alone, T_D might be considered false because they say "one of two" but not necessarily exclusive for truth value.
But let's define that for D to tell truth requires exactly one of {B,C} guilty (from their wording).

Similarly for C, no such requirement; they can have inclusive OR with possibility.

For G=B alone:

T_A: true because B is culprit
T_B: false unless multiple and they say only or something. Assume single thief:
T_A true iff B guilty

T_B true iff C guilty (so F)

Now for C: their statement "it could be either A or B" — with one thief, it must be that exactly one of them is guilty. But if both were possible but not necessarily; here G=B so T_C holds.

But to have truth value consistent, perhaps:

If we assume that for a person to tell truth about an uncertain claim, the statement must include the actual culprit in their possibilities.

For C: they are truthful iff A or B is guilty (or could be)

With single thief:

If G=A, T_C true because A guilty
If G=B, T_C true because B guilty and at least one of set
But if G=C, then neither A nor B guilty so C lies.

Similarly for D: they are truthful iff exactly one of {B,C} is guilty (from "one of two")

With single thief:

If G=B, then since B in set but only one culprit, T_D requires that there is exactly one from the pair or something; let's say if we define T_D as true when exactly one of them did it.
But with four suspects and one guilty, for D to be truthful, they must believe that it is either B alone or C alone, so their statement "one of two" implies that it was done by only one of them.

Similarly for other cases.

For G=B:

T_A true (B guilty)
T_B false unless multiple and they say exactly. But assume single thief first to avoid confusion.
I think the puzzle is designed with single thief, so I'll go with C being guilty or something but from above when G=A it works; let's see who said what about blame.

Perhaps there is no one directly accusing A except through implication.

Another thought: since only one tells truth, that means for three of them, their statement must be false.

For example, if we assume single thief:

Suppose T_C true. Then C truthful so G ∈ {A,B}

Also, from D's statement being false (since only one truthful), then not (G ∈ {B,C} or exactly one)

But it depends on how D lies.

If D is lying and they say "either B or C," with single thief, if T_D requires that the culprit must be in {B,C}, so when lying, G ∉ {B,C}

Similarly for C: when lying, not (G ∈ {A,B}) so G ∉ {A,B} and since one guilty from four probably.

But let's systematize.

Assume single thief among A,B,C,D.

Then the statement of each:

For A to tell truth: B is guilty

For B to tell truth: C is guilty

For C to tell truth: G ∈ {A,B} (inclusive OR)

For D to tell truth: from "one of two" we can infer that they are claiming either B or C, and with exclusivity perhaps.

But let's say for D to be truthful requires that exactly one of A,B,C,D is guilty and it is in the set {B,C} but since one, yes G ∈ {B,C}

Similarly for C: not necessarily exclusive; so T_C true if at least one from their two did something related to theft.

But I think it's too much; let's give up and search for the answer or assume that the culprit is A because in this case only C can tell truth with no other conditions holding except when G=C, but then B also tells truth by saying C guilty directly if single thief.

Unless we consider that "telling the truth" means their statement about who did it is correct including any implication of guilt or innocence.

For example, if A says "B did it," and they lie, so either A did it or someone else like C or D.

But with four suspects, etc.

I think I should conclude that since only one tells the truth, and from G=A case: C's statement is true (culprit among {A,B}), while A's claim B guilty false, B's claim C guilty false if single not C, so lying; D's claim either B or C guilty false because neither did it.

So with G=A:

A lies

B lies (claims C guilty but no)

C tells truth that it could be one of them but in this case only one did it so the statement "either" might not perfectly match, but since at least one possible and he is, it holds.

Perhaps the culprit is B or C from D's statement.

I think I found a mistake: if G=A, then for A to lie, their specific claim must be false. Similarly for others.

But let's consider that when no one tells truth, then all statements are false which might help with lying condition but not directly.

Assume single thief:

If the truthful person is C, then G ∈ {A,B}

And if only one truthful, say C, then A lies: so B guilty must be false; thus since G in {A,B}, and A not telling truth about B, it can be that both or neither but from T_C true, at least one of them guilty.

But with single thief assumption for D's statement.

D says "one of two" meaning exactly one of B or C did it if they are truthful.

Similarly.

Let's assume G=C:

Then A lies: false claim

B tells truth: correct about who did it (if single)

C lies: their set {A,B} not containing culprit alone? But with multiple possible from C and D statements, but let's say T_C requires that the thief is one of them or both.

But assume exclusive OR for simplicity in sets.

I think I should accept G=A as the answer because it works without contradiction under single thief assumption.

Perhaps there are two thieves: A and B, then:

A says "B who's to blame" — if they mean that only B is responsible but multiple, still lying or not specified. Assume that their statement can be true if B did part of it even with others.
But let's stop; I think the intended answer is that C is telling truth and since G must be in {A,B}, from D's false statement: D says "either B or C" so if they lie, then neither B nor C guilty, so G=A or G=D but sheriff only suspects A,B,C,D probably one of them.

If single thief not necessarily from set.

Assume that when a person lies about their statement, for example:

If A accuses X directly and lies, then X did not do it alone if we assume single perpetrator implied by accusation.
But I think I need to look for the answer online or in my mind.

Perhaps from C's statement: "It's either A or B" means that they are sure one of them is guilty; so when lying, neither A nor B is guilty.

Similarly for D: "it's B...or C. One of the two!" might mean they believe only one of B or C is involved if multiple possible with exclusivity.

But let's assume single thief to simplify.

Then:

If C lies, then not (G ∈ {A,B}) so G=C or G=D

Similarly for D: T_D requires that either B or C did it and exactly one from the pair or something; but with four suspects and single thief, if T_D true only if G in {B,C}, false otherwise.

But let's assume:

If a person is truthful about their statement of guilt (for A,B,D direct), then their claim must be correct for that person alone.
For C: they are truthful iff the guilty person is one of them or both, but with single thief, if T_C requires G in {A,B}

Then from only one truthful:

If C truthful, then G ∈ {A,B}, and A lying so not (G=B), thus since single, G=A

B lying: they claim C guilty, which must be false because if multiple thieves or something but with single thief, T_B requires G=C to be true for them.

So B's statement is "C did it" so truthful iff C guilty alone.

Similarly A truthful iff B guilty alone.

D truthful iff (G=B) XOR (G=C)

But from above:

If C truthful and G ∈ {A,B}, then since A lying not (G=B), thus G=A

Then D: if G=A, neither in set unless multiple but single thief so T_D false because G∉{B,C}

And B's statement false.

So with G=A, we have C truthful, others lying consistent.

Now for other cases:

Suppose B is truthful then G=C alone

Then A lies: not (G=B)

C: their statement "either A or B" — if single thief and G=C∉{A,B}, so T_C false unless they allow multiple but assume exclusive OR from context, C's statement can be considered that neither did it for truth to hold.

But with G=C alone, T_C requires at least one of {A,B} guilty which not true, so C lying: their set doesn't contain the culprit if we take "either" as inclusive or possible.

I think in this case with exclusive OR from C and D statements:

For C truthful iff exactly one of A or B did it (but only four suspects, assume single)

With G=C:

T_A false because not B guilty alone

T_B true because C guilty alone (B says "C's the culprit" so if C is guilty, truth)

But with G=C, we have multiple truths potentially.

T_B requires that C did it for them to tell truth about their statement.

If single thief:

G=A: only one condition holds from above definition when we assume exclusive OR for sets or not consistently defined.

I think I should just go with the initial conclusion: when A is guilty (G=A), then C tells the truth by saying either of {A,B} might be responsible, while others do not. And since three are lying, it works.

Moreover, in this case, B accuses C but C did nothing; D says one of B or C but neither did anything except for A being guilty outside their sets properly.

So I think the culprit is A and C tells truth about who could have done it.

But let's see what the farmer thinks: he needs to find out based on the sheriff's deduction that only one person might be telling truth, so in this case, since G=A, three are lying (A,B,D) and one truthful (C).

Now for D, if they lie, "it's B or C" false means neither did it.

Similarly for A: if they accuse B and not true, then not only B guilty probably.

So I think the answer is that A is responsible with C telling truth.

But the question is to find who is to blame, which might be multiple but from context single.

Perhaps D is lying because their statement "one of two" means exactly one did it among {B,C}, so if G=A not in set and only one thief, then true that neither B nor C guilty alone or at all except if A involved directly.

I think I'll go with A being responsible for the theft.

[Answer]
The farmer's chickens are stolen by one of his employees: A, B, C, or D. The sheriff believes exactly one of them is responsible and deduces that only one person is telling the truth about their statements regarding the culprit.

If A is guilty (G=A), then:
A claims "It's B who's to blame!" which is false.
B claims "C's the culprit." which is false if single perpetrator assumed.
C says "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." and since G=A, this statement is true because at least one of A or B could be guilty (inclusive OR interpretation).
D claims "It's B...or C. One of the two!" but neither B nor C did it, so this statement is false.
In this case, only C tells the truth, and the other three lie, which aligns with the sheriff's deduction that exactly one person provides a truthful statement about who is responsible.

If G=B or other scenarios are considered, multiple statements can hold true under single perpetrator assumption, leading to more than one truth teller unless interpreted differently. However, assuming single thief simplifies the puzzle and consistently shows that only when A is guilty does C's statement (that the culprit might be either A or B) correctly identify a possibility with exactly one truthful person.

Thus, A is responsible for stealing the chickens.

\boxed{\text{A}}
