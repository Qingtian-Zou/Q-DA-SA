# Thinking

I have a puzzle with four suspects, A, B, C, and D, each making a statement about who stole the chickens. Only one is telling the truth, and I need to figure out who is responsible based on that.

Here are their statements:

- A: "It's B who's to blame!"

- B: "C's the culprit. No doubt about it."

- C: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..."

- D: "It's B...or C. One of the two!"

Only one is telling the truth, so three are lying.

Since only one is truthful, and their statements must be consistent with that, I need to consider each possibility where one person is correct and see if it holds up.

Also, since chickens were stolen, exactly one person did it—assuming no group or multiple responsibility here. The problem doesn't specify, but in these kinds of logic puzzles, usually only one is guilty.

Now, let's look at C's statement: "It's either A or B." This means that if C is telling the truth, then the culprit is either A or B. But since there might be multiple liars or something? No, I think we should assume that exactly one person stole the chickens, as it's a common setup.

D says "B or C", so similarly, D claims only B or C could have done it if truthful.

A and B are pointing fingers directly at someone else.

Let me denote:

- If A is true, then B is guilty.

- If B is true, then C is guilty.

C's statement: "Either A or B" — this means that the culprit must be one of them for C to be telling truth. But it doesn't specify which one; so if C is true, and say A is not guilty, then B must be guilty? Let's think carefully.

If C says "either A or B", in logic terms, that means at least one of A or B is the culprit. But since only one can be guilty (I assume), it would mean exactly one of them is guilty.

But let's confirm: if there's only one guilty person, then "A or B" being true could mean either A or B did it, but not necessarily both. Since we're dealing with single responsibility, I'll proceed under that assumption.

Similarly for D, "B or C" means the culprit is B or C.

Now, since only one is telling the truth:

Case 1: Suppose A is truthful.

Then B is guilty.

But if A is truthful, then B is lying. So B's statement must be false. B says "C's the culprit", so if false, C did not do it. But we have B guilty, so C didn't do it, that matches.

Now, since A is true, only one truthful, so C and D are lying.

C lies: C said "either A or B" is guilty, but since C is lying, this cannot be the case if only one truthful? No.

If C is lying, then his statement is false. His statement is "A or B" — meaning at least one of them is guilty or exactly one?

In logic puzzles, when someone says "either A or B", it often implies they are both possibilities and not exclusive, but in this context, since only one is to blame probably, we need to specify.

The problem doesn't explicitly say that only one person stole the chickens. It just says all his chickens are gone, so likely one did it, but maybe more than one? But typically, these puzzles assume single culprit unless specified otherwise.

Let's look back at C and D: they both use "either...or" which might suggest inclusivity or exclusivity?

In English, "it's either A or B" often means that the answer is one or the other, but not necessarily exclusive; it could be ambiguous.

But in many logic contexts, especially with a single culprit, we assume that if C says "A or B", and it's true, then exactly one of them is guilty. Similarly for D.

Moreover, A and B are saying specific people are guilty: "it's B" or "C".

Now, the key point is only one person tells the truth.

So let's first assume that there is a single culprit.

Then:

- If A true, then B guilty. Then C lies because if C were telling truth, "A or B" would include B who is guilty, but since exactly one is guilty, and B is guilty, A cannot be guilty, so "either A or B" — well, it's a bit messy.

If there is only one culprit:

- If A says "B is guilty", true iff B guilty, false otherwise if not B.

Similarly for B: true iff C guilty.

C says "A or B is guilty". Since single culprit, this means the culprit must be either A or B. So C's statement can be true in two cases: if A guilty or if B guilty. But since only one truth teller, we need to see when it holds.

Similarly for D: "B or C" — so if single culprit, true iff culprit is B or C.

Now, let S_A, S_B, etc., denote the statements being true or false depending on who did it.

But easier to consider cases based on truthfulness of one person.

Start with A truthful.

If A true: then B guilty.

Since only one true, B must be lying. B says "C is culprit", so if C not guilty, this is false, which matches since B is lying.

Now, C lies. C said "A or B" — in single culprit case, "either A or B" means the culprit is one of them, but since B is guilty (from A), and there's only one, then A is not guilty, so indeed A did not do it, B did, so "A or B" with B being true part, so if we interpret C as saying exactly that the culprit is among {A,B}, then since B is culprit, this statement should be true. But C is lying, so contradiction.

C's statement: "It's either A or B."

If we assume single culprit, and it means at least one of them did it (but in context, probably exclusive), let's clarify the meaning.

In logic terms, when someone says "either P or Q" without specifying if both can be true, but here since only one is likely to blame, C might mean that the guilty person is A or B, implying not others.

Similarly for D: "B or C", so probably means the culprit is B or C, and since single, it's exclusive.

But let's see what happens if we don't assume single culprit first.

Perhaps I should consider the possibility of multiple culprits, but that might complicate things. Let's stick with single for now.

Another way: list all possibilities who did it and see which one makes only one statement true.

Assume exactly one guilty person.

Then:

- If A says "B", so S_A is true if B guilty, false otherwise.

- Similarly, S_B true if C guilty, false otherwise.

C's statement: "Either A or B" — let's parse this. In English, it can be ambiguous whether "either" means inclusive or exclusive. But in most such contexts, I think we take it as the culprit is one of them, so for single culprit, S_C true if (guilty = A) or (guilty = B).

Similarly, D: "B or C", so S_D true if guilty = B or guilty = C.

Now, only one of these statements is true.

Statements are about who did it, and the person's truthfulness depends on that.

Let me denote the culprit as X. X can be A,B,C,D but since they're suspects and one might not have been home or something? The problem doesn't say anything about D being able to do it; all could potentially be guilty I think.

But let's see: if X is B, then:

S_A true because "B" is correct.

S_B false because C did not do it (assuming single culprit).

C says "A or B": since X=B, so S_C should be true.

D says "B or C": X=B, so part of it is true, so S_D true if we take inclusive "or".

But with multiple statements potentially true: when X=B, both A and C would say something that matches the truth. But only one can tell truth.

If X=B:

- A's statement: B guilty, true

- B's statement: C guilty, false (since B guilty)

- C's statement: "A or B" — since B guilty, this is true because at least one condition holds.

- D's statement: "B or C" — B guilty, so true.

So S_A true, S_C true, S_D true. But three are telling truth if X=B, but only one should be, contradiction. So cannot be that B did it.

If B is guilty and A tells truth by saying B is guilty, then C's statement "A or B" — since B guilty, even though we don't know about A, but in this case A not guilty (single culprit), so "either A or B" could be interpreted as the choice between them for blame.

But anyway, multiple statements true if X=B: S_A true, S_C true because guilty is one of {A,B}, and S_D true because guilty is one of {B,C}. Only S_B false.

Since three are true when B guilty, but only one truth teller required? No, the condition is that exactly one statement is true, I think. The problem says "only one of these people is telling the truth", meaning only one person's statement is correct or consistent with reality.

In this case, if X=B:

A: yes, B guilty

C: not necessarily A but B, so he said either, which includes possibility that B did it

D: similarly included B in his "or"

So all three statements by A,C,D are true because they include the correct person or statement.

But only one should be telling truth. So indeed, if B is guilty, multiple truths exist, not good.

Similarly, let's check other possibilities systematically.

Assume C did it: X=C

Then:

- S_A: says "B", but X=C, so false

- S_B: says "C", true (since C guilty)

- S_C: "A or B" — both A and B not guilty if single culprit, so this is false. Since C's statement claims that the culprit is either A or B, which it isn't.

- S_D: "B or C" — X=C, so part of it true (C), but since or, as long as one is true, D's statement should be considered true? Let's define truth value carefully.

S_D says "it's B or C", meaning if culprit is B or C then true. Here X=C, so S_D is true.

Also, A and B statements are about who did it: S_A false since not B, S_B true since C guilty.

Now, with multiple truths: S_B true, S_D true (because C), S_C false because neither A nor B guilty if single culprit.

X=C, so A and B not guilty, so "A or B" is false. D's statement "B or C" is true because C.

So S_A false, S_B true, S_C false, S_D true.

Two truths: B and D telling truth, but only one should be truthful. Contradiction.

Assume A did it: X=A

Then:

- S_A: says "B", but X=A, so false (since not B)

- S_B: says "C", X=A, C not guilty unless multiple, single culprit, so false if C not guilty.

S_B is true only if C guilty. Here C not guilty, so S_B false.

Now, S_C: "A or B" — X=A, A guilty, so this should be true (since at least one condition holds).

But we need to check truthfulness.

If X=A:

- Statement by A: "B is guilty", but actually A guilty, not B, so false

- Statement by B: "C is guilty", C not guilty if single, so false

- Statement by C: "Either A or B" — since A guilty, this true. Also, it could be interpreted as the culprit is one of them.

- Statement by D: "B or C" — neither B nor C guilty (assuming X=A), so S_D false.

So statements:

S_A false

S_B false

S_C true (since A is guilty)

S_D false (guilty not B or C)

Now, only C has a true statement. But we have four people: if X=A, then S_A false because he blamed someone else; similarly for others except C.

C said "either A or B", which includes the possibility that A did it, so yes, S_C is consistent with fact and would be telling truth.

But in this case, only one truthful person: C. And culprit is A.

Now, let's check D's statement if X=A not guilty for him.

D says "B or C" — both false, so liar.

A says B guilty but A did it, lie.

B says C guilty, but neither A nor C? Wait no, single culprit, so C not guilty, lie.

C tells truth: either of them is possible.

But the problem is to find who stole the chickens based on this condition that only one truthful statement.

In this case with X=A, we have S_C true and all others false. That seems consistent.

Now, similarly assume B did it, but earlier when X=B, multiple truths.

X=B: S_A true (B guilty), S_B false if C not guilty? Let's specify.

If X=B:

- A says "B", so S_A true

- B says "C is culprit", which is false since B guilty and single

- C says "A or B", now if we think of it as the statement that the culprit must be one of them, then with B guilty, this should be true.

But let's define: C's statement S_C means that either A or B (or both) did it. Since only one, and B did it, so S_C is true because "A or B" includes B being true when considered as a whole proposition.

Similarly D says "B or C", which with X=B, should be true if we take inclusive or.

But in terms of truth-telling: A tells truth by saying B guilty, B lies since he said C, but not C, so false statement. C tells truth because his statement is correct (culprit among them), D also tells truth because "B or C" includes B.

So S_A true, S_C true, S_D true — three truths, not good.

Now, assume X=D guilty? But we don't know about others being capable, but let's try all cases.

X=D:

- A says "B", false (D guilty)

- B says "C", false

- C says "A or B" — both A and B not guilty if single, so S_C false

- D says "B or C" — neither, so S_D false

Now all statements false? But then no one is telling truth, but the problem requires that only one is truthful. So this cannot be.

Thus X=D is impossible since it leads to contradiction with there being exactly one truth-teller.

X=C: when C guilty,

S_B true (C culprit), S_C "A or B" false if neither, and S_D true ("B or C", C included).

In single culprit case:

If X=C, then A not guilty, B not guilty, so C's statement is false because neither A nor B did it.

D's statement: since C guilty, D says "B or C", which includes the correct one (C), so if we think of S_D as true when guilty is B or C.

Similarly for others.

So X=C:

- S_A: "B guilty" — false

- S_B: "C guilty" — true

- S_C: "A or B guilty" — both not, so false (assuming single culprit)

- S_D: "B or C guilty" — C is guilty, so true.

Thus S_B and S_D are true, S_A and S_C false. Two truths again.

Now X=B already did multiple.

What about if no one else? But we need to find who stole them.

Another possibility: maybe more than one could be guilty, but that might not fit the statements well.

For example, C says "either A or B", which implies he thinks it's between them, so probably culprit is only among some possibilities.

D similarly.

But let's first see with single culprit assumption we have a case where X=A seems to work.

With X=A:

- S_A: claims B guilty — false

- S_B: claims C guilty — since A guilty and not C, false if single

- S_C: "A or B" — true because A is guilty (and even though B might be innocent, but statement says either one could do it)

In terms of truth value, we need to define what the statements imply.

Perhaps think in terms of who they accuse and possibilities.

Another way: since only one tells truth, their statements are consistent with that being true or not.

Let me list all four cases for single culprit:

1. If B guilty (X=B):

- S_A true

- S_B false if C not guilty (which is true)

- S_C: "A or B" — A not, B yes so true

- S_D: "B or C" — B yes, C no but since inclusive or, still true? Or do we consider the statement as a whole?

The statements are:

A says: B is guilty.

So if X=B, S_A true; otherwise false.

B says: C is guilty. So if X=C, S_B true; else false (since single culprit).

C says: either A or B is guilty. Which means that the set {A,B} contains the culprit. If culprit not in {A,B}, then S_C false; else true.

D says: either B or C is guilty. Similarly, if culprit not in {B,C}, S_D false; else true.

Now for single culprit:

Case X=A (culprit A):

- S_A: since B guilty? False

- S_B: since C guilty? False (A is guilty)

- S_C: either A or B guilty — yes A, so True

- S_D: either B or C guilty — no, only A, so if {B,C} does not contain A, false. Since single culprit and X=A not in {B,C}, so S_D false.

Thus truth values: S_A False, S_B False, S_C True, S_D False → one true statement (C)

And C is the truthful one by saying it was either A or B, which turned out to be A.

Now case X=B:

- S_A: B guilty? True

- S_B: C guilty? No, false

- S_C: either A or B guilty — yes B, so True (A not but B is)

- S_D: either B or C guilty — yes B, so True if we consider the statement as "B or C" with one being true.

Since X=B, and {B,C} contains B, S_D should be considered true because it matches the possibility that one of them did it.

But S_C also includes him.

In fact:

- S_A: directly says guilty is B, so if X=B, True

- S_B: says C guilty, but X=B not C, False

- S_C: says culprit in {A,B}, yes B, so True

- S_D: says culprit in {B,C}, yes B, so True → three truths.

Not good for single truth teller.

Case X=C:

- S_A: B guilty? No, false if not C

X=C, so A statement is "B guilty" but X=C, so unless multiple, it's wrong. Single culprit, S_A false

S_B: C guilty? Yes, True

S_C: either A or B guilty — no, only C, both not in {A,B}, so False (assuming single)

S_D: either B or C guilty — yes C, and since "or" includes it if one is true, but S_D means that the culprit must be B or C.

In this case, X=C, which is part of D's statement, so S_D should be True because at least one condition holds (C).

Similarly, with single culprit:

S_A false

S_B true

S_C "A or B" — neither A nor B guilty? No, only C, so both not, thus S_C claims that either is true, which is false if exactly one and it's C.

But let's think: C says "either A or B", meaning the culprit was likely from A or B group, but in fact it wasn't. So if X=C, S_C can be considered false because it denies possibility of others being responsible directly.

In logic terms, S_C is equivalent to saying that the culprit is not anyone else besides possibly A and B? But with multiple possible, we need to specify.

Perhaps for C's statement: "It's either A or B." If this means that only possibilities are A or B, then if X=C, it directly contradicts because C was not considered. Similarly, D says "B or C", implying others cannot be.

I think in the context of such puzzles, when someone says "either P or Q" without qualification, it often implies exclusivity: that one and only one is responsible among them. But here A and B say specific people, so let's see.

To avoid confusion, let's assume single culprit for now.

Case X=D:

- S_A: claims B guilty — false

- S_B: claims C guilty — false (since D)

- S_C: "A or B" — both not guilty if only one and it's D, so S_C false unless we consider multiple.

But let's stick to single culprit first.

With X=D:

S_A false (guilty is not B)

S_B false (not C)

Now for S_C: if X=D, then "either A or B" — neither did it, and since only one, D must be guilty but not mentioned by C. So S_C claims that the culprit should be among them to blame, so probably S_C is false.

Similarly S_D: "B or C" — both not guilty if X=D single, so S_D false.

Thus all false, no truth teller, impossible.

Now case X=B and X=C already done multiple truths.

What about if A guilty? We have that with one true statement from C.

But let's check the other statements to see if they are consistent being lies or whatever.

The problem is only that one person tells truth, so in this scenario, when A guilty, S_C is true and others false. Good.

Now, similarly, what about B guilty? But three truths: A,C,D all claim correctly except C's statement might be different from direct accusation but still correct.

A says "B", D says "B or C" with B included so if X=B, both are consistent.

C's statement also includes B possibility.

Only B is not telling truth because he blamed wrong person.

But S_C and S_D are true even though they didn't specify directly who it was but their general statement covers the case.

Now for multiple culprit or something else?

Another thing: C says "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." — this might imply that both are possibilities, so perhaps he is considering a scenario where one of them could be guilty but maybe only one did it? But his honesty is based on the statement being true.

Perhaps we need to consider that if C is truthful, then indeed either A or B is guilty (but not specifying which).

But in our case with X=A, S_C is true because A or B is guilty.

Similarly, suppose D is truthful: says "B or C" so culprit must be one of them. Then only one truth teller, so others lying.

If S_D true, then guilty = B or guilty = C (assuming single).

Now if guilty=B:

Then as above, multiple truths except possibly some lie? But when X=B, S_A true, S_C true because "A or B" includes B, etc. Contradiction unless we define the statements differently.

Perhaps for C's statement: since he says "either A or B", and he is not sure which, it might be that even if both are possible, but only one did it, his statement can still be true as long as at least one of them could have done it. But in truth-telling context, if the culprit is not from {A,B}, then "either A or B" would be false because neither did it.

But let's think about C being truthful and others lying.

First, suppose S_C is true: that means either A or B is guilty (so not D at least, but could both?).

Assume single culprit for simplicity.

Then if S_C true, X=A or X=B.

Now only one truth teller, so the other statements must be false except C's.

Statements are about who did it individually except C and D which have "or".

Also B might lie by omission or something but let's see.

Perhaps we should consider that A,B,C,D could all be guilty in some cases? But unlikely with the statements.

Another idea: maybe the truthful person is one of them, and their statement must be correct based on who did it.

But since only one truthful, three are lying, meaning their accusations or generalizations are wrong.

Now let's consider from C's perspective. If C is truthful, then "either A or B" means that culprit was indeed among A or B (so not others).

Then for S_C true:

- Either X=A or X=B

But since only one truth teller, S_A must be false because if X=A, S_A says B guilty but it's not necessarily lie? S_A is "B guilty", which would be false if X=A.

Similarly, S_B: if S_B true then C guilty, so for S_C true and S_B false, we need that C was not guilty when X=A or X=B.

If S_C true (X in {A,B}), and only one truthful:

- If X=A, then as before, S_A false (said B), S_B false if C not guilty, which is the case since single culprit X=A≠C. And S_D: "B or C" — neither, so if we take it literally, S_D should be considered true only if {B,C} contains the culprit.

But when X=A, S_D claims that culprit must be B or C, but A is not one of them, so false statement.

S_B claims C guilty, which is false unless multiple.

With single culprit:

If X in {A,B}, then for S_C true (covers both possibilities).

Now S_A: if X=B, then S_A says "B" and it's correct; but S_A cannot be true because only one truthful. So when S_C true, we need S_A false.

S_B similarly must be false unless C guilty.

But let's case by case based on who is the truth-teller.

Start with A being truthful: so S_A true, B guilty.

Then others must lie:

B lies: but S_A says B guilty, which is correct, but if only one truthful, and B says "C is culprit", for this to be a lie since B guilty not C, so yes false statement as long as single culprit or we assume that the truth is about who did it.

With B guilty:

S_B: claims C guilty — wrong if B did it alone, so S_B should be considered lying unless multiple.

But let's keep single for now.

A truthful: X=B

Then statements must all except A be false.

So S_B false → since "C culprit" but X=B not C, true that not necessarily C, or directly if we think B says the truth only when C guilty, else lie.

S_C: claims "either A or B", with single culprit and X=B, this is true because at least one of them is guilty (B).

But S_C must be false since A truthful alone. Contradiction.

Therefore cannot have A truthful if single culprit assumed.

Earlier I thought when X=A only C can be truthful but let's confirm the cases again.

Perhaps multiple culprits possible.

For example, if B and C both guilty? But then statements might not hold.

But let's assume single culprit first since it makes more sense with the "either or" implying choice among few.

Another thing: D says "It's B...or C. One of the two!" which explicitly states that one of them did it, so S_D means only possibilities are B or C for the thief.

Similarly, C says "It's either A or B", but doesn't specify exclusive, and he is not sure, which might imply both could be guilty, but let's see what he said: "I'm not sure which" suggests that it was one of them but we don't know who.

But to find inconsistency.

Perhaps list all possible guilty persons and check truth values with single culprit assumption.

Guilty person possibilities: A,B,C,D

With each:

If X=A:

- S_A (claims B) : false

- S_B (claims C): if X=A not C, then false unless multiple. Single culprit, so false

- S_C ("either A or B"): since A guilty and in {A,B}, this can be considered true because the statement holds.

- S_D ("B or C"): neither B nor C guilty, so S_D claims that one of them must have done it but actually not, so false. Also "one of the two" implies only possibilities are B or C for thief.

So with X=A:

S_A: incorrect

S_B: incorrect (since not C)

S_C: correct because A is in {A,B}

S_D: incorrect because thief is neither B nor C; it's A, who was not mentioned by D? Or if multiple, but single assumed.

Thus one true statement: S_C from C.

Now X=B:

- S_A (claims B): true

- S_B (claims C): false since X=B ≠C

- S_C ("either A or B"): yes, includes B, so true (if we think of it as the set contains culprit)

- S_D ("B or C"): includes B, and says one is guilty which matches if single.

S_D: "one of the two" — truth-teller for D means that indeed thief is from {B,C}.

Similarly, with X=B, all statements except possibly some are consistent but:

A true (said B), C true because he said either A or B and B did it, so his statement includes possibility, thus correct. D also says one of them did it, which matches if single culprit is in {B,C}.

But S_C might not be directly claiming that only one of them was responsible; he just says "either" without saying exclusive, but in context, I think we can take it as the thief is among A or B for his statement to be true when lying about others? Let's see.

Perhaps define truth value based on what they state.

For example:

- If S_A: "B guilty" — this means that A asserts B did it. So if B did, and no one else (single culprit), then S_A is correct; similarly for false.

But for C: he says "It's either A or B", meaning the thief was from {A,B}, so if single culprit not in {A,B}, his statement is false because wrong person or not among them.

If single and X=B, then thief is indeed from {A,B}, so S_C true.

Similarly for D: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" meaning that he asserts only B or C could have done it; if other did, false.

In that case:

When X=B guilty (single):

S_A: says B, correct → True

S_B: says C, incorrect since not C, False

S_C: says either A or B — thief is from them, so includes this possibility, True

But S_D: "one of the two" means only possibilities are B and C for thief. Since X=B which is one of them, true statement.

So all except B have true statements? No:

A: thief is B → correct if single

C: thief in {A,B} → correct since B there

D: thief in {B,C} → correct since B there

And S_B incorrect.

Thus three truths, not good for only one truthful statement with single culprit assumption.

Therefore X=B cannot be the case because multiple statements true or consistent.

Similarly for X=C:

S_A says "B", but C guilty so false unless multiple.

Single: S_A false (not B)

S_B says "C", correct → True

S_C says either A or B, thief not in {A,B} if only C, then False

S_D says B or C, thief is C which is one of them, True.

So again two truths: B and D.

Not good for single truth-teller scenario.

Now X=D:

Single culprit: S_A false (not B)

S_B false (not C)

S_C "either A or B" — both not guilty if only D, so thief not among {A,B}, thus statement false

S_D "B or C" — both not guilty, thief is D, not in set, so statement should be considered false because he said one of them but it's neither.

Thus all statements false. No truth teller, impossible.

Therefore with single culprit assumption, the only consistent case is when X=A, and S_C is true while others are false.

In this case, C tells truth: either A or B did it (and indeed A), so statement correct even though not specifying which one.

Others lying:

A says "B" but it's not; lie

B says "C" but neither; lie

D says thief must be from {B,C} but it's A; lie if we take the implication of his words strictly, or consistent with what he said?

Now, but there might be another possibility: perhaps multiple people could be responsible.

For example, suppose both B and C are guilty? But then statements:

S_A says "B" — true because B guilty

But if only one truthful required, others must lie. S_B says "C", which is also true since C guilty; but if both A and B tell truth by their specific claims, contradiction.

Moreover D might say something.

Assume two or more guilty possible to see if other scenarios fit.

The problem doesn't specify that it's single person, so let's consider the possibility of multiple.

But then statements:

A: "It's B who's to blame!" — this might imply only B is responsible for all chickens gone? But not clear. Perhaps we need to interpret as at least B did something or full responsibility?

In context, probably means that B took the chickens.

Similarly, C and D use "either...or" which can be inclusive if multiple are possible but let's see.

To simplify, perhaps stick with single culprit since it worked for one case.

But in X=A case, only C tells truth with her statement being true about who did it.

Now, what if no one is guilty? But all chickens gone, so someone must have done it probably.

Assume the thief is among them.

Another thing: D says "B or C" and specifies "one of the two", which might imply that only possibilities are B or C for single culprit, but not necessarily.

In X=A case, with multiple possible, A could be guilty alone without issue from C's statement.

But let's see if we can have a consistent scenario where D is truthful.

Suppose S_D true: then thief must be either B or C. And since only one truth teller, others lying.

S_A false → not B guilty (since single culprit in {B,C}, but could both?)

Assume first that with S_D true, and single culprit among {B,C}.

Then if X=B:

As before, multiple truths: A says "B" correct; C says "either A or B" — since thief is B, it might be considered one of them, so correct; D also correct. But only S_B false because he blamed wrong person? S_B claims C guilty but not.

But if X=B and single culprit among {B,C}, then:

- S_A true (said "B")

- S_B: since thief is B, not C, so S_B says "C" which is incorrect, lie

- S_C: if we interpret his statement strictly for single culprit, it should be false unless X in {A,B}. Since X=B, yes.

But with multiple:

Perhaps the truthful statements don't have to specify exclusively; they just need to be correct factually or logically consistent.

For example, C says "either A or B", meaning that we can say for sure the thief was from them. So if thief not in {A,B}, then his statement is false because it's incorrect to say one of them did it (unless multiple but let's assume).

Assume single culprit first.

From above, only when X=A do we have exactly one truthful: C.

Otherwise:

- If X=B, three truths from A,C,D

- If X=C, two truths from B and D? S_B true because he said C guilty, S_D true if {B,C} includes C, S_C false unless thief in {A,B}, but C not, so S_C claims "either" which might be exclusive or inclusive.

Let's define the statements precisely based on logic.

Perhaps think of it as: each statement assigns guilt or alibi to certain people.

But let's consider that only one person is telling truth about who did it.

C says "It's either A or B", so if he tells truth, then guilty party must be among {A,B}, and not specified which, but true that one of them did it.

Similarly for D: if S_D true, then guilty party in {B,C}.

Now with single culprit assumption:

- If C truthful (S_C true), then X ∈ {A,B}

Then other statements false:

S_A: claims "B", so not B guilty → but X=B is possible from above? Contradiction unless we specify.

If S_C true, and only one truthful, then S_A must be false, which means that it's not the case that B is guilty. But if X∈{A,B}, and S_C says either A or B, so for example if X=A, then S_A claims "B" but actually not B, so S_A false good.

If X=B, S_A claims "B" which would be true if X=B, but only one truthful, so S_A cannot be true when C is. So with single culprit, if C truthful, then thief must be A or B, and also for S_A to be false (since not the only truth), we need that it's not B guilty; because if X=B, S_A would be true.

Similarly from above: S_B claims "C" so if S_B were true, C guilty but with single culprit, can't have both A or B and C unless multiple.

But let's state:

If C is truthful (S_C true), then either A or B is the culprit.

And since only one truth-teller, other statements are lies.

A must lie: A says "B" so for him to lie, it cannot be that B is guilty. Therefore, if S_C true and S_A false, then not X=B, but from S_C true X∈{A,B}, so X=A (since not B)

Similarly, B must lie: B says "C", so liar implies C did not do it; which matches since X=A.

Now D must lie: D says "one of them" meaning thief in {B,C}. Since X=A not in {B,C}, this is false that one of them (D's) did it, so S_D false correct for lying scenario.

Therefore with C truthful and single culprit assumed, we get X=A as the only possibility to have all except C lying or something? Let's see:

If S_C true: thief ∈{A,B}

Then S_A must be false → not B guilty

But from above, if thief in {A,B} and not B, then A guilty.

S_B must be false → not C guilty (which is consistent)

S_D must be false → so it cannot be that thief was one of them; D's statement "B or C" implies that if this were true, then S_D would be correct, but since he lies, we need S_D false, meaning thief not in {B,C}.

With single culprit, X=A is outside {B,C}, so yes S_D false.

Now similarly, let's consider B being truthful.

If S_B true: C guilty

Then others must lie:

S_A lies → says "B" but if C guilty alone, then B did not do it, and A lying by saying he thinks B done or something. But S_A claims that B is guilty, which is false since X=C≠B, so S_A false good for liar.

C lies: C says "either A or B", now with single culprit C, this would be incorrect if thief not in {A,B}, and indeed X=C not among them, so S_C should be considered false (lie) because it claims one of the possibilities is true but actually neither did it alone? With single culprit, S_C states that the culprit must be from {A,B}, which isn't C.

But also C says "I'm not sure which" which might imply he thinks both could have done or something else, but let's see his statement as a whole: "It's either A or B." meaning for him to tell truth, at least one of them is guilty (if multiple possible) or exactly from set.

To avoid confusion, assume single culprit unless necessary.

If S_B true and X=C:

Then S_A must be false → since not C, S_A claims "B" so it's a lie if B innocent.

S_C: liar implies that his statement "either A or B" is false. If thief in {A,B}, then he tells truth by saying either; but here thief is C, not in set, so if we take "either...or" as inclusive for possibility, S_C could be true only if one of them guilty.

But with X=C single, neither A nor B guilty, so S_C false correct for lying when required.

Now D must lie: S_D says "B or C", but X=C guilty, so this is true because part included. But we need all except B to lie since only one truthful.

S_B true, and others should be lies.

But if X=C, S_D claims "one of them" — thief in {B,C}, which includes C, so it's correct that C or B did it; even though not specifying who, but the statement is accurate because at least C did something? But typically we think about single person stealing all chickens probably.

Perhaps better to keep consistent with previous case where X=A worked without multiple.

But let's check D being truthful now.

Suppose S_D true: thief in {B,C}

Then others must lie except D.

S_A lies → claims "B" false, so not B guilty

Therefore since thief in {B,C} and not B, then C guilty.

From above:

If S_D true: X ∈ {B,C}

And S_A must be false because liar if only one truthful. So S_A claims "B" is guilty, but false statement → B did not do it (since single culprit or even multiple).

But with thief in {B,C}, and B not doing it? Then C must have done it.

Similarly, S_B: says "C", now X=C, so if S_B true then correct. But we need all except D to lie because only one truthful is D.

S_B claims "C" which would be true if X=C.

But in this case with X=C and S_D true, both B and C statements might conflict.

Specifically:

If S_D true: thief ∈ {B,C}

Then for A liar (S_A false): since he says "B", false means not B guilty.

Thus thief cannot be B, so from {B,C}, must be C.

Now X=C

Then check truth values:

S_B claims "C" — which is correct if X=C single culprit or even multiple but let's assume single for simplicity. Since S_D true and we have only one truthful (D), then others including B should lie? But S_B says "C", and C guilty, so unless the statement requires him to say something else.

The truthfulness depends on whether their claim matches reality.

In this case with X=C:

S_A false because not B

S_B true because said C correct

But if only one truthful allowed, then both A and B cannot be involved; here S_B is also potentially true.

Specifically: since thief is C (X=C), S_B says "C" which should be considered as he correctly identifies the culprit or something? But in terms of truth-telling about responsibility.

Perhaps we need to consider that each person's statement must be evaluated based on who they point to or what set they cover.

But let's go back to the original approach with X=A only C truthful works.

Similarly, if we assume multiple culprits possible but I think it complicates and probably not intended since statements don't suggest multiple accusations except implicitly.

Another case: suppose thief is B (single)

Then S_A true

S_B false unless he says something else

But S_A true means A tells truth by blaming right person; so if only one truthful, then C must lie or D etc., but in this case with X=B, multiple statements true as per earlier.

Similarly for other cases except X=A which is consistent under single culprit assumption and that the "either" implies a possibility set rather than exclusive OR.

In general:

- A's statement: "B guilty"

- B's statement: "C guilty"

- C's statement: "A or B guilty", meaning thief in {A,B}

- D's statement: "B or C guilty", meaning thief in {B,C} (and since he says one of them, for single culprit)

Now with these sets:

Only one person tells truth about the guilt.

Case 1: A truthful → S_A true: B guilty. Then from above, if B guilty, then S_C might be true or not depending on interpretation; but let's see what others say must be false.

Since only one truthful, statements by C and D should reflect that.

But with X=B:

S_D says "B or C", which is correct because thief in {B,C}, so even if single, it includes B.

Similarly S_C says "A or B" , including B.

Both would hold true except possibly A's statement is specific but still correct.

Only B lies by saying wrong person.

But three truths not allowed.

Case 2: If C truthful → thief in {A,B}

Then for others to lie, A must be lying so not B guilty. Therefore from above, thief cannot be B, and from S_C true it could be A or B, but since B not guilty (from A lying), then thief must be A.

Similarly, D lies: S_D says thief in {B,C}, false because if single culprit X=A outside, so correct that C truthful alone with this deduction.

Case 3: If B truthful → C guilty

Then others lie except B.

A lies: claims "B" but not true since X=C≠B (assuming no multiple)

C lies: his statement S_C says thief in {A,B}, which is false because X=C not, so liar good if single culprit.

D lies: S_D says thief in {B,C}, C guilty yes included, so should be true unless we consider that D is lying by saying something incorrect. But it includes the correct possibility, so hard to say he is lying.

For example with multiple possible, but let's assume single.

If X=C:

S_B true (said C)

Then S_D says "B or C" — thief is one of them? Since only C guilty, and D didn't specify which one, his statement that it was either B or C could be considered correct because we don't know if B did too much or something.

But typically in such puzzles, when someone says a set contains the culprit, it means they are claiming that person is responsible.

Perhaps for simplicity, assume single responsibility and see.

Case 4: If D truthful → thief in {B,C}

Then others lie except D.

A lies: claims "B" false, so not B guilty. Therefore since thief in {B,C}, must be C guilty (if multiple or single).

But with single culprit X=C:

S_B says "C", which is true if X=C; but we need all except D to lie because only one truthful.

Inconsistency: S_B would be correct, so another truth-teller.

Unless the statement by B and A are about who did it directly, not general sets.

But in this case with X=B or C from above cases.

Perhaps there is no other possibility besides X=A where only one tells truth under single culprit assumption.

What if thief is D?

Then S_A: claims "B" but not true, false

S_B: claims "C" not true (D), so if we think he says the person who did it, then false; or general set, no.

Single culprit X=D:

- Not B guilty → S_A false

- Not C guilty → S_B false unless multiple, single so false for accusation

But statements: A and B are specific accusations.

C's statement "either A or B" — thief not in {A,B}, so if he says one of them did it, but actually D did, then his statement is incorrect, so lie (if we take the truth value as whether what he said is true).

Similarly D's statement: if X=D, and S_D says "B or C", which are false for both since not guilty.

Then all statements false except possibly no one truthful.

But earlier with single culprit in {A,B}, it works when C truthful.

Another possibility: perhaps the liar condition means that their statement is incorrect about who did it.

In general, let's list:

Truth-teller possibilities and who must be guilty for consistency.

First, if A truthful → B guilty. But then S_C says thief in {A,B} which includes truth (B), so C also truthful unless we define "truthful" differently or assume single.

But the problem is only one person telling truth about their statement being correct.

In X=B case: both A and C have true statements because C's statement holds due to B being guilty.

Similarly, in X=C case: S_B true (C), and S_D true if thief in {B,C}, but also D might be lying or something.

But let's see the answer from the initial consistent scenario.

Perhaps I should consider that when C says "either A or B", it doesn't specify which, so for him to tell truth, we don't know who did it as long as one of them.

Similarly for others.

The condition is only one truthful, not necessarily about knowing who it was.

But in this case with X=A, all except C are lying because their specific claims or sets are wrong except C's set includes the thief.

Let me assume that each person has a statement that must be evaluated as true or false based on whether they correctly identify or state the guilt situation.

For A: S_A is "B guilty" so if B did it, true; otherwise not necessarily false but in context probably false unless multiple and no specification.

To make progress, let's assume that there was a single thief, and each person either points to one wrong person (lie) or C/D have set conditions.

Then from above:

Only when X=A do we get exactly one truthful: C with her statement "either A or B" being correct because A is guilty; while S_A false since not B, S_B false since not C, and if single culprit, S_D false since thief not in {B,C} unless D did.

In all other cases for X=B or C or D, multiple statements are true or no truth teller.

X=D: all false except possibly some interpretation of "one" but let's say S_C might be considered to imply both could have done if he said either, but in fact not from context; similarly D says B or C one did it, which is wrong for single thief being neither.

Therefore X=A seems the only consistent possibility with exactly one truthful person: C.

Moreover, in this case, D's statement "B or C" would be false since A guilty not them, so he lies correctly as per condition.

Also, B accuses wrongly by saying C did it but actually no, so lie.

A accuses wrongly by blaming B when C and D didn't do anything probably.

The thief is A, who might have stolen the chickens themselves.

But let's confirm if there are other possibilities with multiple thieves or something else.

Suppose that both A and B could be guilty? Then S_C says "either" so true; but then multiple truths possible unless we consider only one truth-teller.

If both A and B guilty, then S_A claims "B", which is true part since at least B did it; similarly S_B claims C, might not be true if single set or something messy.

Assume the puzzle has a unique solution with single thief.

Then from above, when X=A, only C tells truth as per his statement being correct about the possibility (A or B), and others incorrect because they point to wrong people specifically under single thief assumption.

Therefore the farmer should suspect A for stealing all chickens.

But let's see who could have done it based on statements.

Another way: since three are lying, their statements must be false.

If C is telling truth, then S_C true → guilty in {A,B}

And with X=A or B, but if X=B, S_A also true, so for only one truthful, cannot have both A and C true unless we consider that when thief is B, C's statement "either" could be ambiguous.

But to avoid ambiguity, let's assume single thief not necessarily from the sets mentioned except by the truthful or lying person.

I think I should go with X=A as the answer based on initial reasoning.

So who stole the chickens? A did it.

Then truth-teller is C.

And we found that only one case satisfies: when A is guilty, and C tells the truth about "either" being correct but not specifying which; while others are wrong.

Moreover, in D's statement, he says B or C one of them, implying if anyone else did it, false. Here since single thief A, not B or C, S_D false.

Similarly for all.

Therefore I think that is the solution.

# Answer

Based on the statements provided and the condition that only one person is telling the truth:

- If C is truthful, their statement "It's either A or B" means the culprit must be among A or B. For this to hold without contradiction (i.e., so others are lying), it cannot be B guilty because A would then also be truthful by claiming B as the culprit. Similarly, if C were truthful and D's statement included a possibility of C being guilty, that might create an inconsistency with only one truth-teller.

- With a single thief assumption:
  - If the thief is A: S_C (C) is true because A or B is guilty; S_A (A), S_B (B), and S_D (D) are false. This satisfies the condition of exactly one truthful person.
  - If the thief is B: Multiple statements could be true, including S_A, S_C, and possibly S_D if "or" includes B as a possibility, so it cannot hold with only one truth-teller.
  - If the thief is C or D: Multiple statements can still be true due to overlapping possibilities in C and D's generalizations.

Thus, the consistent scenario is that A stole all the chickens.
