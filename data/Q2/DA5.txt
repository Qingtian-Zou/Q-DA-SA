[Thinking]
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have four suspects: A, B, C, D. Each made a statement, and only one of them is telling the truth. The rest are lying. We need to determine who the real culprit is.

First, let me list out their statements again to be clear:

A says: "It's B who's to blame!"
B says: "C's the culprit. No doubt about it."
C says: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..."
D says: "It's B...or C. One of the two!"
Only one of these statements is true. So, our job is to check each possibility (assuming each person is the culprit) and see which scenario results in exactly one truthful statement.

Let me start by considering each suspect as the culprit one by one.

Case 1: Suppose A is the culprit.

If A is guilty, then let's check each statement:

A's statement: "It's B..." – False, since A is guilty. So A is lying.
B's statement: "C's the culprit." – False, since A is guilty. So B is lying.
C's statement: "It's either A or B." – Well, since A is guilty, this statement is true. Wait, C says "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." Hmm, does "either A or B" mean that one of them is guilty? If A is guilty, then C's statement is true? Wait, but C says "I'm not sure which..." So maybe C is trying to say that it's either A or B, but not sure which. If in reality it's A, then C's statement would be true? Hmm, this is a bit tricky.
Wait, the problem says "only one of these people is telling the truth." So we have to take each statement as a whole.

Let me parse C's statement again: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." So C is saying that the culprit is either A or B, and he's not sure which. If the culprit is actually A, then C's statement is true because it's either A or B (it's A). But C says he's not sure which. Hmm, does that matter? Wait, maybe the "I'm not sure which" part is part of the lie? Wait, no. If someone says "It's either X or Y. I'm not sure which," then if it's actually X, then the first part is true (it's either X or Y) but the second part "I'm not sure which" would be a lie because he actually knows it's X. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe in logic puzzles like this, when someone says "It's either X or Y," it's meant to be a statement that the culprit is one of them, regardless of the "I'm not sure which" part. Maybe the "I'm not sure" is just C's uncertainty but in the context of the puzzle, we just take the statement as "the culprit is either A or B." Similarly, D says "It's B or C," meaning the culprit is either B or C.

So perhaps we can ignore the "I'm not sure" and "one of the two" parts as just phrasing. Let's try that.

So rephrasing each statement as:

A: Culprit is B
B: Culprit is C
C: Culprit is A or B
D: Culprit is B or C
Given that, then we can model each case.

So starting with Case 1: A is guilty.

Check each statement:

A says culprit is B: False
B says culprit is C: False
C says culprit is A or B: True (since A is guilty)
D says culprit is B or C: False (since A is guilty)
So in this case, only C is telling the truth. But the problem states that only one person is telling the truth. Wait, so if A is guilty, then C is truthful. But according to this, that would mean only C is truthful. But the problem says only one is truthful, so this case could be possible? Wait, but hold on, the problem says "only one of these people is telling the truth." So if A is guilty, then C is truthful, others are lying. So that would be exactly one truth-teller. Hmm, so this could be a candidate.

But wait, let's check the other cases to see.

Case 2: B is guilty.

Check each statement:

A: says culprit is B – True
B: says culprit is C – False
C: says culprit is A or B – True (since B is guilty)
D: says culprit is B or C – True (since B is guilty)
Wait, so in this case, A, C, D are all telling the truth. That's three truths. But we need only one. So this case is invalid.

Case 3: C is guilty.

Check statements:

A: culprit B – False
B: culprit C – True
C: culprit A or B – False
D: culprit B or C – True (since C is guilty)
So here, B and D are truthful. Two truths. Not good.

Case 4: D is guilty.

Check statements:

A: culprit B – False
B: culprit C – False
C: culprit A or B – False
D: culprit B or C – False (since D is guilty)
Wait, so in this case, all statements are false. But the problem states that one person is telling the truth. So this case is invalid.

Wait, hold on. Wait, in Case 4, D is guilty. So D's statement is "culprit is B or C". Since D is guilty, that's a lie, so D is lying. So all four are lying. But the problem says exactly one is truthful, so this case is impossible.

Wait, so according to this analysis:

Case 1: A guilty → C truthful (1 truth)
Case 2: B guilty → A, C, D truthful (3 truths)
Case 3: C guilty → B, D truthful (2 truths)
Case 4: D guilty → 0 truths

Hmm, so only Case 1 gives exactly one truth-teller (C). But wait, the problem says "only one of these people is telling the truth". So according to this, A is guilty. But wait, the problem says "they're all pointing fingers at each other". Hmm.

Wait, but hold on, in C's statement: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." If we take the "I'm not sure which" part into account, does that affect the truthfulness?

For example, if C says "It's either A or B" (so the culprit is A or B) and "I'm not sure which", then if the culprit is A, then C's statement is partially true and partially... Hmm. Maybe in logic puzzles, we usually take the entire statement as a single proposition. So if someone says "X or Y", it's a single statement that the culprit is one of them. The "I'm not sure" might just be C's uncertainty but not part of the logical statement. So maybe in this problem, we can ignore the "I'm not sure" part and just consider the content of the statement.

Assuming that, then Case 1 gives us C as the truth-teller, so A is guilty.

Wait, but let me check again.

Wait, but the problem says "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So if A is guilty, then:

A lies
B lies
C tells the truth (culprit is A or B)
D lies
So only C is truthful. So that would fit.

But wait, the answer might be different. Wait, let me check another angle.

Wait, another way: Maybe the statements have to be entirely true or entirely false. For example, C says "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." So if the culprit is A, then the first part is true, but the second part "I'm not sure which" would be false because C actually knows (if he's truthful). Wait, this complicates things.

Hmm, this is a point where the interpretation matters. In some logic puzzles, the "I'm not sure" is part of the statement, so if the culprit is A, then C's statement "It's either A or B" is true, but "I'm not sure which" would be a lie because he actually knows it's A. Wait, but in reality, C is making the statement, so if he's lying, he might be saying something that's not true. Hmm.

This is a bit ambiguous. Let's see.

Suppose we take C's statement as two parts: (1) The culprit is either A or B; (2) I'm not sure which.

If C is telling the truth, then both parts must be true. So culprit is A or B, and C is not sure which. But if culprit is A, then C would be sure it's A (if he's truthful), but he says he's not sure. So maybe in this puzzle, the "I'm not sure" is part of the lie.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem expects us to ignore the "I'm not sure" part and just consider the first part as the statement. Let's try that.

Assuming that:

A: culprit = B
B: culprit = C
C: culprit ∈ {A, B}
D: culprit ∈ {B, C}
Then, as per earlier analysis:

Case 1: A guilty → C's statement is true (since A is in {A,B}), others false. So 1 truth.

Case 2: B guilty → A and C and D's statements are true? Wait:

Wait, A says culprit is B: true.

B says culprit is C: false.

C says culprit is A or B: true (B is guilty).

D says culprit is B or C: true (B is guilty).

So three truths. So invalid.

Case 3: C guilty.

A: false

B: true

C: false (culprit is C, not A or B)

D: true (culprit is C, so in {B,C})

So two truths.

Case 4: D guilty.

All statements false.

So only Case 1 gives exactly one truth-teller (C). But wait, the problem says "only one of these people is telling the truth". So according to this, A is guilty.

But wait, I have a feeling that maybe the answer is different. Let me check again.

Wait, another thought: If C is the one telling the truth, then culprit is A or B. If A is guilty, then C is truthful. If B is guilty, C is truthful. But in Case 2, B is guilty, then A, C, D are truthful. So if the culprit is A, only C is truthful. If culprit is B, three are truthful.

Wait, so according to this, only A being guilty gives exactly one truth-teller.

But let me check if there's another angle.

Wait, what if the truth-teller is someone else?

Suppose the truth-teller is A. Then A's statement is true: culprit is B. Then B is guilty.

But if B is guilty, then:

B's statement: "C is culprit" – false

C's statement: "culprit is A or B" – true (B is guilty)

D's statement: "culprit is B or C" – true (B is guilty)

So A, C, D would all be truthful. But we supposed only A is truthful. Contradiction. So A cannot be the truth-teller.

If truth-teller is B: B says culprit is C. So C is guilty.

Then:

A: says B is guilty – false

B: true

C: says culprit is A or B – false (C is guilty)

D: says culprit is B or C – true (C is guilty)

So B and D are truthful. Not good.

If truth-teller is C: C says culprit is A or B. So culprit is A or B.

We need all others to be lying.

So:

A lies: so culprit ≠ B

B lies: so culprit ≠ C

D lies: so culprit ∉ {B, C}

So from D's lie: culprit is not B and not C.

From A's lie: culprit ≠ B.

So culprit must be A or D.

But C says culprit is A or B, so since culprit must be A or D (from above), but C's statement would then be true only if culprit is A. Because if culprit is D, then C's statement "A or B" is false.

Wait, this is getting more complex.

Let me formalize this.

Assume C is the truth-teller.

Then:

Culprit is A or B.
Also:

A is lying ⇒ culprit ≠ B

B is lying ⇒ culprit ≠ C

D is lying ⇒ culprit ∉ {B, C}

From A lying: culprit ≠ B

From C's statement: culprit is A or B. But since culprit ≠ B (from A lying), culprit must be A.

So culprit is A.

Check if this holds:

A lies: culprit ≠ B → true (culprit A)

B lies: culprit ≠ C → true

D lies: culprit ∉ {B, C} → true (culprit A)

So yes, this works. So culprit is A.

Alternatively, suppose D is the truth-teller.

D says culprit is B or C.

Then:

A lies ⇒ culprit ≠ B

B lies ⇒ culprit ≠ C

C lies ⇒ culprit ∉ {A, B}

From D's truth: culprit ∈ {B, C}

But from A lying: culprit ≠ B

From B lying: culprit ≠ C

Contradiction. So impossible.

If truth-teller is A: culprit = B.

But then C and D would also be telling the truth, as before.

If truth-teller is B: culprit = C.

Then D's statement "B or C" would be true (culprit C), so D is also truthful. So two truth-tellers.

So the only possible case is C being the truth-teller, culprit is A.

Wait, but the problem says "the farmer comes back to his chicken coop to find the door open and all his chickens gone! He tells the sheriff..." So the culprit is one of A, B, C, D.

But according to this analysis, culprit is A.

Wait, but let me check once more.

Wait, in some logic puzzles, the person who is guilty might not be one of the four? But no, the problem says "they're all pointing fingers at each other" meaning A, B, C, D are the suspects.

Hmm. Wait, but according to the initial problem statement: "He tells the sheriff, who works out either A, B, C or D is responsible". So yes, culprit is one of them.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes these puzzles have a twist.

Wait, another way: Let's make a table.

Let's denote T for truthful, L for liar.

We need exactly one T.

Case 1: A is guilty.

A: L (says B)

B: L (says C)

C: T (says A or B)

D: L (says B or C)

Total T: 1 → valid.

Case 2: B is guilty.

A: T

B: L

C: T

D: T

Total T: 3 → invalid.

Case 3: C is guilty.

A: L

B: T

C: L

D: T

Total T: 2 → invalid.

Case 4: D is guilty.

A: L

B: L

C: L

D: L

Total T: 0 → invalid.

So only Case 1 works. Therefore, culprit is A.

But wait, the problem says "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So according to this, A is guilty.

But I have a doubt because sometimes in these puzzles, the answer might be different. Wait, let me check online if this is a known puzzle.

Wait, no, I shouldn't do that. Let me think again.

Wait, in Case 1, C says "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." If the culprit is A, then C's statement is true in the sense that it's either A or B, but C says he's not sure which. If C is truthful, then he is saying that the culprit is either A or B, and he doesn't know which. But in reality, it's A, so does that make his statement partially true and partially... Hmm.

If the puzzle expects us to take the entire statement as true, then C is truthful. If the "I'm not sure" part is considered a lie, then if C is truthful, he would know, but he's not sure. Wait, this is a possible point of confusion.

For example, if someone says "It's either A or B, and I'm not sure which," then for the entire statement to be true, it must be that the culprit is A or B, and the speaker is indeed unsure. But if the culprit is A, then the speaker would be sure it's A (if he's truthful), so he wouldn't say he's unsure. Therefore, maybe in this puzzle, the "I'm not sure" implies that the speaker is lying about being unsure.

This is a common issue in logic puzzles with such statements.

Let's consider this angle.

Suppose that when C says "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which...", the truthfulness of the entire statement depends on both parts.

If C is truthful:

The culprit is A or B.

C is not sure which (i.e., he doesn't know, but in reality, he might be lying about not knowing).

But in the context of the puzzle, we might assume that the "I'm not sure" is just C's way of saying he doesn't know, but the key part is the culprit being A or B.

Alternatively, if the statement is considered as a single proposition: "The culprit is either A or B," then the "I'm not sure" is extra information that doesn't affect the truth value.

This is a bit of a problem. Given that this is a puzzle for a general audience, likely they expect us to treat each statement as a simple assertion of the culprit being one of the mentioned.

Given that, our initial analysis holds: culprit is A.

But wait, I recall a similar puzzle where the answer was D, but maybe not.

Wait, let me try another approach.

Assume each person is the truth-teller and see if it leads to consistency.

First, assume A is truthful.

Then culprit is B.

But then:

B says culprit is C → lie

C says culprit is A or B → true (B is guilty)

D says culprit is B or C → true (B is guilty)

So two truth-tellers (A and C), which contradicts only one truth-teller. So A cannot be truthful.

Assume B is truthful.

Culprit is C.

Then:

A says culprit is B → lie

B says culprit is C → truth

C says culprit is A or B → lie

D says culprit is B or C → truth

Two truth-tellers (B and D). Not good.

Assume C is truthful.

Culprit is A or B.

Now, since C is truthful, others are lying.

A lies ⇒ culprit ≠ B

B lies ⇒ culprit ≠ C

D lies ⇒ culprit ∉ {B, C}

From A lying: culprit ≠ B

From D lying: culprit ≠ B and ≠ C

So culprit must be A or D.

But C says culprit is A or B. Since culprit ≠ B (from A lying), culprit must be A.

So culprit is A. Check:

A lies: culprit ≠ B ✔️

B lies: culprit ≠ C ✔️

D lies: culprit ∉ {B,C} ✔️

All others are lying. So this works.

Assume D is truthful.

Culprit is B or C.

Others lie:

A lies ⇒ culprit ≠ B

B lies ⇒ culprit ≠ C

C lies ⇒ culprit ∉ {A, B}

From D truthful: culprit ∈ {B, C}

But A lying ⇒ culprit ≠ B

B lying ⇒ culprit ≠ C

Contradiction. So impossible.

Therefore, only possible case is C is truthful, culprit is A.

Wait, but the problem says "the farmer comes back to his chicken coop to find the door open and all his chickens gone!" So the culprit is one of A,B,C,D. According to this, A is guilty.

But I have a hesitation because sometimes in these puzzles, the answer is different. Wait, let me check once more.

Wait, in the problem statement: "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So according to our analysis, A is guilty.

But maybe I made a mistake in interpreting C's statement.

Wait, C says: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..."

If the culprit is A, then C's statement "it's either A or B" is true, but "I'm not sure which" is a lie because he's sure it's A (if he's truthful). Wait, this is a key point.

If C is telling the truth, then he must be unsure, but if the culprit is A, then he should know it's A, so he wouldn't say he's unsure. Therefore, in this puzzle, the statement "I'm not sure which" adds a layer of meaning.

This is a common type of puzzle where the speaker's certainty affects the truthfulness.

For example, if someone says "It's X or Y, and I'm not sure which," then for the statement to be true, it must be that the culprit is X or Y, and the speaker is genuinely unsure (i.e., the culprit is neither X nor Y, but he says it's X or Y and is unsure? Wait, no.

Actually, this is a bit more complex.

In logic puzzles like this, when a person says "It's X or Y, and I don't know which," the truthfulness of the entire statement requires that:

The culprit is X or Y.

The speaker does not know which one (i.e., the culprit is not uniquely determined by the speaker's knowledge).

But in the context of this puzzle, we might have to assume that the speaker is either lying or telling the truth about the culprit, and the "I'm not sure" part is just part of the statement's phrasing.

Given that this is a puzzle for a general audience, and to keep it simple, it's probably intended that we ignore the "I'm not sure" part and just consider the content of the statement.

Given that, our original conclusion holds: A is guilty.

Wait, but I just found a similar puzzle online where the answer was D, but maybe not exactly the same.

Wait, let's suppose that in this puzzle, the answer is D. Wait, how?

Wait, let's try again.

Suppose culprit is D.

Then:

A: B → lie

B: C → lie

C: A or B → lie

D: B or C → lie

All lying. But problem states one truth-teller, so invalid.

Culprit is C:

A: B → lie

B: C → truth

C: A or B → lie

D: B or C → truth

Two truths.

Culprit is B:

A: truth

B: lie

C: truth

D: truth

Three truths.

Culprit is A:

A: lie

B: lie

C: truth

D: lie

One truth.

So yes, only culprit A gives one truth-teller.

But I have a nagging feeling because sometimes these puzzles have a trick. Wait, the problem says "the sheriff, who works out either A, B, C or D is responsible". So the sheriff is trying to figure it out, but the problem says "only one of these people is telling the truth". So according to this, culprit is A.

Wait, but let me check with another perspective.

Suppose the answer is B.

Wait, no, in culprit B case, three truths.

Wait, unless...

Wait, hold on. Wait, in the problem statement: "Only one of these people is telling the truth."

If the culprit is C, then B and D are truthful. If culprit is D, all are lying. If culprit is A, C is truthful. If culprit is B, three truthful.

So yes, only A.

But I recall a similar problem where the answer was different because of the "or" statements. Wait, perhaps in this case, the answer is D?

Wait, no, according to the analysis, it's A.

Wait, let's try to see.

Wait, another angle: If D says "It's B or C", so if the culprit is D, then D is lying. But if we consider that "B or C" could be interpreted as "exactly one of B or C", but usually in logic puzzles, "or" is inclusive.

Hmm.

Wait, I think my original analysis is correct. So culprit is A.

But I want to be 100% sure.

Let me try to write it out.

If A is guilty:

A says "B" → lie

B says "C" → lie

C says "A or B" → truth

D says "B or C" → lie

Exactly one truth. Correct.

If B is guilty:

A: truth

B: lie

C: truth

D: truth

Three truths.

If C is guilty:

A: lie

B: truth

C: lie

D: truth

Two truths.

If D is guilty:

All lies.
So yes, only A being guilty satisfies the condition.

Therefore, the culprit is A.

But wait, the problem says "the farmer comes back to his chicken coop to find the door open and all his chickens gone!" So it's a bit odd that A is the culprit because A is the farmer's neighbor? Wait, no, the problem says "a farmer comes back... he tells the sheriff, who works out either A, B, C or D is responsible". So A, B, C, D are the suspects, presumably people living around.

But regardless, according to the logic, it's A.

Wait, but I just thought of something. In some versions of this puzzle, the answer is D because of a different interpretation. Let me see.

Wait, suppose that C's statement "It's either A or B" is considered a lie if it's not exactly one of them, but in this case, it's a disjunction.

Wait, no, I think we've covered it.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation or wording.

Wait, the original problem says: "C: 'It's either A or B. I'm not sure which...'"

If "it's either A or B" is meant to be "it's A or it's B", which is the same as "A or B".

Given all that, I think the answer is A.

But I have a doubt because sometimes these puzzles have the culprit as the one who is lying about their own statement or something.

Wait, another check: If culprit is A, then C is truthful. So C says "it's either A or B", which is true, and "I'm not sure which". If C is truthful, then he is unsure, but in reality, it's A. So does that mean C is lying about being unsure?

Ah! This is the crux.

If C says "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which...", for C to be telling the truth, two things must be true:

The culprit is A or B.

C is not sure which one (i.e., he doesn't have information that would let him know it's A or B).

But in reality, if the culprit is A, then C's statement "it's A or B" is true, but he should be sure it's A (if he's truthful), so saying he's "not sure" would be a lie.

Wait, this is a critical point.

In other words, the statement has two parts:

The culprit is A or B.

C is unsure which.

For the entire statement to be true, both parts must be true.

If the culprit is A, then the first part is true, but the second part ("I'm not sure which") is false because C would know it's A (if he's truthful). Therefore, C's entire statement would be a lie.

Similarly, if the culprit is B, same thing.

If the culprit is neither A nor B, then the first part is false.

So this changes everything.

This is a common issue in logic puzzles where the speaker's certainty affects the truth value.

Let's re-analyze with this in mind.

Assume that for C's statement to be true:

Culprit ∈ {A, B}
AND

C does not know which (i.e., the culprit is not uniquely determined by C's knowledge)
But in the context of the puzzle, we might assume that the only way C would say "I'm not sure" is if it's actually one of A or B, but he can't tell which. However, since all the suspects are the only ones who could have done it (as per problem statement), maybe C's "I'm not sure" is a lie.

This is very ambiguous.

Let's try this approach:

If C is telling the truth, then:

Culprit is A or B.

C is genuinely unsure (which might imply that it's not determinable from the context, but in the puzzle's context, we might not have that information)

But given that the sheriff is trying to figure it out, perhaps we have to assume that the "I'm not sure" is part of the lie.

Alternatively, the puzzle expects us to ignore the "I'm not sure" part.

Given the time I've spent, and considering that in most similar puzzles the "I'm not sure" part is disregarded for the sake of the puzzle's logic, I think the intended answer is A.

But I've seen a version of this puzzle where the answer is D. Wait, let me think.

Wait, suppose we consider that D's statement "It's B or C" means "exactly one of B or C", but even so.

Wait, let's try assuming that the truth-teller is D.

If D is truthful: culprit is B or C.

Others are lying:

A lies: culprit ≠ B

B lies: culprit ≠ C

C lies: culprit ∉ {A, B}

From D: culprit ∈ {B, C}

From A: culprit ≠ B

From B: culprit ≠ C

Contradiction. So impossible.

If truth-teller is C:

Culprit ∈ {A, B}

A lies: culprit ≠ B

B lies: culprit ≠ C

D lies: culprit ∉ {B, C}

From A: culprit ≠ B, so culprit = A

Then:

A lies: ✔️

B lies: culprit ≠ C ✔️

D lies: culprit = A ∉ {B, C} ✔️

So this works, but with the caveat about C's "I'm not sure".

If we assume that the "I'm not sure" is a lie, then C's statement would be a lie. Let's explore that.

Suppose that "I'm not sure which" is a lie, meaning that C is sure which one it is.

So if C is lying, then either:

The culprit is not A or B, or

C is sure which one it is.

But this complicates things.

Let's try this interpretation:

Each person's statement has two components:

The factual claim (culprit is X)

The assertion about knowledge ("I'm not sure")

For the entire statement to be true, both must hold.

If the statement is a lie, then at least one part is false.

This is getting too complex for a puzzle that likely expects a simple answer.

Given the problem's context, I think the expected answer is A, with the "I'm not sure" part being disregarded.

But wait, another way: In the problem statement, it's said that "only one of these people is telling the truth". So if we go with the simple interpretation where each statement is a single assertion (ignoring the "I'm not sure" and "one of the two"), then culprit is A.

However, I just recalled a similar problem where the answer was D because of a different setup. Let me try one last time.

Wait, suppose the culprit is D.

All statements are lies.

But problem states one truth-teller, so invalid.

Culprit is C: two truth-tellers.

Culprit is B: three.

Culprit is A: one.

Yes, so answer is A.

But I have a doubt because when I search my memory, there's a puzzle like this where the answer is D, but maybe not.

Wait, here's a different take: Maybe "only one of these people is telling the truth" means that only one person is truthful, and the rest are lying. So our analysis holds.

Given that, I think the answer is A.

Wait, but the problem says "the farmer comes back to his chicken coop to find the door open and all his chickens gone!" So it's plausible that the farmer's neighbor A did it, but maybe not.

Alternatively, the problem might have a typo or different intended answer.

Wait, let me try to see if there's another way.

Suppose that when C says "It's either A or B", he means "exactly one of A or B", but in logic puzzles, "or" is usually inclusive.

Alternatively, if the culprit is D, then all are lying, but the problem says one truth-teller.

Wait, no.

I think after careful consideration, the answer is A.

But hold on, I found an identical puzzle online (in my mind), where the answer is D. Wait, no, let's think.

Wait, here's a different approach: Let's list all possibilities with the "I'm not sure" as a lie.

Assume that when someone says "I'm not sure", they are lying. So:

If C is truthful: culprit is A or B, and C is unsure (but this is a lie, so C is sure)
Wait, this is too convoluted.

Given the time I've spent, I think the answer expected here is A.

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, in the problem statement: "D: 'It's B...or C. One of the two!'"

So D is saying it's one of B or C, i.e., exactly one. But in logic puzzles, "or" is usually inclusive, so "B or C" means at least one.

But if D is saying "it's B or C", and in reality it's D, then D is lying.

But back to our analysis.

I think I have to go with culprit is A.

But now I'm confused because I recall a similar problem where the answer was different.

Wait, let's try to see:

If the answer were D, then all are lying, which is not possible.

Wait, another idea: Maybe "only one of these people is telling the truth" means that only one person is truthful, and the rest are lying. So our analysis holds.

Given that, the answer is A.

But to confirm, let's see:

If A is guilty:

A lies

B lies

C tells truth

D lies

Yes, only C is truthful.

Therefore, the culprit is A.

But I have a last check.

Suppose the answer is C.

Wait, no, if culprit is C, then B and D are truthful.

No.

Okay, I think I've exhausted the possibilities. I think the answer is A.

Final Answer
\boxed{A}

[Answer]
To determine who is responsible for the chickens going missing, we analyze the statements made by each of the four suspects (A, B, C, D), under the condition that only one of them is telling the truth.

Step 1: Understand the Statements
Let’s rephrase each statement for clarity, focusing on the core factual claim (ignoring the "I'm not sure" or "one of the two" phrasing for simplicity, as is standard in such logic puzzles):

A: "It's B who's to blame!" → Culprit = B
B: "C's the culprit." → Culprit = C
C: "It's either A or B." → Culprit ∈ {A, B}
D: "It's B or C." → Culprit ∈ {B, C}
We are told only one of these four is telling the truth. That means three are lying.

Step 2: Evaluate Each Case (Who is the Culprit?)
Let’s test each possibility for the culprit and count how many statements are true.

✅ Case 1: A is the culprit
A says: "It's B" → False
B says: "It's C" → False
C says: "It's A or B" → True
D says: "It's B or C" → False
✅ Only C is telling the truth → This matches the condition.

❌ Case 2: B is the culprit
A says: "It's B" → True
B says: "It's C" → False
C says: "It's A or B" → True
D says: "It's B or C" → True
❌ Three truths → Does not match the condition.

❌ Case 3: C is the culprit
A says: "It's B" → False
B says: "It's C" → True
C says: "It's A or B" → False
D says: "It's B or C" → True
❌ Two truths → Does not match the condition.

❌ Case 4: D is the culprit
A says: "It's B" → False
B says: "It's C" → False
C says: "It's A or B" → False
D says: "It's B or C" → False
❌ Zero truths → Does not match the condition.

Step 3: Conclusion
Only Case 1 (A is the culprit) results in exactly one truth-teller (C), which satisfies the condition that only one of the four is telling the truth.

While the phrasing of C's statement includes "I'm not sure which," in the context of logic puzzles like this, it is standard to interpret such statements as factual claims (i.e., "the culprit is A or B") rather than including the speaker's certainty. Therefore, the "I'm not sure" is typically not considered part of the truth value in such puzzles.

Final Answer
A
