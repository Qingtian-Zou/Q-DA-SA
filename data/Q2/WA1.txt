[Answer]
Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

Assume A is telling the truth: If A is truthful, then B is guilty. This means B, C, and D are all lying.

If B is lying, then C is not the culprit.
If C is lying, then it's not either A or B. This contradicts our initial assumption that A is truthful and B is guilty. So, A cannot be telling the truth.

Assume B is telling the truth: If B is truthful, then C is guilty. This means A, C, and D are all lying.

If A is lying, then B is not guilty.
If C is lying, then it's not either A or B (which we know is false).
If D is lying, then B is not guilty and C is not the culprit. This works!

Assume C is telling the truth: If C is truthful, then either A or B is guilty. This means A, B, and D are all lying.

If A is lying, then B is not guilty.
If B is lying, then C is not the culprit.
If D is lying, then B is not guilty and C is not the culprit. This contradicts our assumption that either A or B are guilty. So, C cannot be telling the truth.

Assume D is telling the truth: If D is truthful, then either B or C is guilty. This means A, B, and C are all lying.

If A is lying, then B is not guilty.
If B is lying, then C is not the culprit.
If C is lying, then it's not either A or B (which we know is false). This contradicts our assumption that both B and C are not the culprits. So D cannot be telling the truth.

Therefore, B is the culprit.
