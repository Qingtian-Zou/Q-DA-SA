[Thinking]
We have a logic puzzle. There are four suspects A, B, C, D. They each make statements:

A says: "It's B who's to blame!" (i.e., B did it)

B says: "C's the culprit." (i.e., C did it)

C says: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." (i.e., either A or B did it; but we don't know which)

D says: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" (i.e., either B or C did it, but we don't know which).

Only one of these people is telling the truth. Find who did it.

We need to determine a scenario where exactly one statement is true, the other three false. And we must deduce culprit among A,B,C,D.

Let’s denote T for true statements. Only one is true. Let's analyze each possibility: Suppose A is guilty; then B's statement "C's the culprit" would be false (since C is not guilty). D says "B or C", that would also be false (neither B nor C is guilty, so false). C says "either A or B". If A is guilty, this is true: indeed either A or B did it (A did). So if A is guilty, C's statement is true. That would mean two statements are true (C and maybe others?). Let's check: A says "B" -> false; B says "C" -> false; C says "either A or B" -> true; D says "B or C" -> false. That's exactly one truth? Wait we have only C's statement is true. That would satisfy the condition of exactly one telling truth. But check: Are there any other statements that could also be considered true inadvertently? No, only C's statement. So if A did it, we have exactly one truth (C). But need to verify whether D's statement might be considered ambiguous or partially true? Let's parse D: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" If neither B nor C did it, then D's statement is false. Yes. So this scenario works.

But hold on: The puzzle says only one person is telling truth. In our scenario with A guilty, we found exactly one truthful statement (C). That seems to satisfy. But we must check whether there could be other possibilities as well; maybe multiple solutions? We need to find the unique culprit that satisfies the condition. Let's test each possibility systematically.

Let’s denote g = guilty person: A, B, C, or D.

We will evaluate truth values of statements:

Statement by A (S_A): "B is guilty." So S_A true iff g = B.
Statement by B (S_B): "C is guilty." So S_B true iff g = C.
Statement by C (S_C): "Either A or B did it" i.e., g ∈ {A, B}. So S_C true iff g = A or g = B.
Statement by D (S_D): "B or C did it." So S_D true iff g = B or g = C.
We need exactly one of S_A,S_B,S_C,S_D to be true. Let's analyze each g:

Case 1: g = A. Evaluate:
S_A: false.
S_B: false (C not guilty).
S_C: true because g in {A,B} -> yes, it's A.
S_D: false because B or C? no.
So we have exactly one truth (C). So this scenario works.

Case 2: g = B. Evaluate:
S_A: true (B is guilty)
S_B: false
S_C: true (g in {A,B}) -> yes, it's B. Wait that would make two truths (A and C).
But also D says "B or C" which includes B; so S_D true as well? Let's check: g = B, then S_D true. That gives 3 truths. So B cannot be guilty because more than one truth.

Case 3: g = C.
S_A: false
S_B: true (C is guilty)
S_C: false (g not in {A,B})
S_D: true (B or C includes C). That gives two truths (B and D). So can't be C.

Case 4: g = D.
S_A: false
S_B: false
S_C: false? Wait S_C says "either A or B" but D is guilty, so false.
S_D: false (g not in {B,C}). So zero truths. But we need exactly one truth. So can't be D.

Thus only g = A yields exactly one truth. So the culprit is A.

But hold on: The puzzle statement says "Only one of these people is telling the truth." That means exactly one, yes. And we found that if A did it, then C's statement is true. Let's double-check for any nuance: The phrase "Only one of these people is telling the truth" might also mean at most one? But typical puzzle interpretation is exactly one.

But there's a twist: Could there be scenario where two statements could be considered partially or ambiguous? For example, D says "It's B...or C. One of the two!" That implies that one of them did it; but if neither did it, D's statement is false. Good.

Now check for any subtlety with C's statement: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." This could be considered true if exactly one of A or B is guilty? But if both A and B were guilty (can't happen), it's still true? But there can only be one culprit. So we treat as g in {A,B}.

Now we should produce answer: The guilty person is A.

But maybe there's another nuance: Suppose D's statement could be considered ambiguous: "It's B...or C. One of the two!" If exactly one of them did it, it's true; if both did or none did? But there can only be one culprit. So either one of them did, which would be true. But in our scenario with A guilty, D's statement is false because neither B nor C did.

Thus answer: A is the culprit. Because only then exactly one statement (C's) is true.

But let's also double-check that no other solution arises if we interpret "only one of these people is telling truth" as at most one? In our case with g = D, there are zero truths; but that's not allowed because it says only one is telling the truth. Usually meaning exactly one. So we can't accept zero.

But let's also check if any scenario could produce exactly one truth for other g values: Let's test again carefully:

If g = B: S_A true, S_B false, S_C true, S_D true. That's 3 truths.
If g = C: S_A false, S_B true, S_C false, S_D true. That's 2 truths.
If g = D: all false => 0 truths.
Thus only g = A yields exactly one truth. So answer is that A did it.

But we need to provide reasoning step by step. Let's craft final answer:

Given statements:
A says B guilty
B says C guilty
C says either A or B guilty
D says B or C guilty

We analyze each possibility:

If A is guilty: Only C's statement true (since he said "either A or B").
If B is guilty: Both A and C say it's B, so at least two truths.
If C is guilty: B and D both correct; again more than one truth.
If D is guilty: None of the statements are true.
Thus only scenario that satisfies exactly one truthful statement is when A did it.

But wait: There might be a subtlety: Could there be possibility that "only one person is telling the truth" means exactly one, but we should also consider whether any statement could be considered ambiguous? For example, D's statement "B...or C. One of the two!" might not be a definite assertion because he says "one of the two." That implies either B or C did it, but maybe both? But no.

Thus final answer: A is guilty.

But we also need to consider possibility that the puzzle may ask "Who is to blame?" The answer: A. Provide explanation.

Let's craft a final response:

Represent each statement as condition.
Evaluate truth values for each suspect.
Only scenario with exactly one true statement corresponds to A being culprit.
Will produce final answer accordingly.

[Answer]
Culprit: A

How we find it
Let the four statements be written as logical conditions:

Person	Statement	True iff…
A	“B did it.”	guilty person = B
B	“C did it.”	guilty person = C
C	“Either A or B did it.”	guilty person ∈ {A, B}
D	“B or C did it.”	guilty person ∈ {B, C}
We test each possible culprit and see how many statements would be true.

Guilty	S_A	S_B	S_C	S_D	#true
A	F	F	T	F	1
B	T	F	T	T	3
C	F	T	F	T	2
D	F	F	F	F	0
Only when A is the culprit does exactly one statement (C’s) come out true.

All other possibilities give either zero, two or three truths, violating the puzzle’s condition that only one person tells the truth.

Therefore the only scenario consistent with the clues is:

The thief was A.
