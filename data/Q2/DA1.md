# Thinking

We have a puzzle with four suspects A,B,C,D. Only one statement is true; others false.

Statements:

A says: "It's B who's to blame!"
B says: "C's the culprit."
C says: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..."
D says: "It's B...or C."

We need to find who actually robbed chickens (the culprit). Only one of these statements is true.

Let’s denote actual culprit X ∈ {A,B,C,D}. For each person, their statement truth value depends on X. Evaluate.

Define:

S_A: X = B

S_B: X = C

S_C: X ∈ {A,B} (i.e., either A or B)

S_D: X ∈ {B,C}

Only one of S_A,S_B,S_C,S_D is true.

We need to find X that satisfies exactly one statement true.

Let's evaluate for each possible culprit:

Case 1: X = A. Then S_A: false (since not B). S_B: false (not C). S_C: true? Since X ∈ {A,B} yes, because A is in set. So S_C true. S_D: false (X∉{B,C}). So only one statement true -> works! So culprit could be A.

Case 2: X = B. Then S_A: true (since B). S_B: false. S_C: true? X ∈ {A,B} yes, so true. That's two statements true. Not allowed.

Case 3: X = C. Then S_A: false. S_B: true. S_C: false because C not in {A,B}. S_D: true because C in {B,C}. So two true (S_B,S_D). Not allowed.

Case 4: X = D. Then S_A:false, S_B:false, S_C:false, S_D:false. None true -> no good.

Thus only A works. Therefore culprit is A. But hold on: we need to check the puzzle description: The farmer says "door open and all chickens gone!" The sheriff works out either A,B,C,D responsible; they all point fingers. Only one statement is telling truth. We found culprit A. But we must also consider that statements could be partially true? The problem states "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So yes.

Thus answer: A stole chickens. Explanation: evaluate each case. Provide reasoning.

Double-check: Are there any nuances like ambiguous wording? D says "It's B...or C" maybe meaning exactly one of B or C? But phrase "One of the two!" could be ambiguous but likely means "B or C." Our interpretation matches puzzle.

Thus final answer: A is culprit.

We can also present logic table. Provide reasoning with elimination. Let's produce final answer accordingly.

# Answer

**Answer – A stole the chickens**

### How to decide

Let  

* \(X\) = actual thief (one of **A, B, C, D**)  
* S_A : “It’s **B** who did it”  → true iff \(X=B\)  
* S_B : “It’s **C** who did it”  → true iff \(X=C\)  
* S_C : “It’s either **A** or **B** (I’m not sure)” → true iff \(X∈\{A,B\}\)  
* S_D : “It’s **B…or C** – one of the two” → true iff \(X∈\{B,C\}\)

The puzzle says *exactly one* of these statements is true.  
Check each possible culprit.

|  X  | S_A | S_B | S_C | S_D | #True |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| **A** | F | F | **T** | F | 1 |
| **B** | **T** | F | **T** | F | 2 |
| **C** | F | **T** | F | **T** | 2 |
| **D** | F | F | F | F | 0 |

Only when the culprit is **A** does exactly one statement (S_C) come out true.  
All other possibilities give either zero or two truths.

Therefore, the thief who stole the chickens must be **A**.
