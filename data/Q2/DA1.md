We have statements, exactly one true. We need find culprit among A,B,C,D. Let’s brute logic. Let culprit X. Evaluate truth values.

Define statement S_A: "B is guilty" -> true if X=B.
S_B: "C is guilty" -> true if X=C.
S_C: "Either A or B is guilty" -> true if X=A or X=B.
S_D: "B or C" -> true if X=B or X=C.

We need exactly one statement true. Try each culprit.

If X=A: S_A false, S_B false, S_C true (since A), S_D false (not B/C). That's 1 true -> works. So culprit A possible.

If X=B: S_A true, S_B false, S_C true? wait C says either A or B; B is guilty so true. S_D true (B). That would be 3 true. Not allowed.

X=C: S_A false, S_B true, S_C false (neither A nor B), S_D true (C). Two trues.

X=D: none mention D, all false. zero true.

Thus only culprit A satisfies exactly one truth. So answer: A is guilty.

# Answer

Let’s check each possibility for the thief and see how many statements come out true.

| Culprit | S_A (“B did it”) | S_B (“C did it”) | S_C (“A or B did it”) | S_D (“B or C did it”) | # True |
|---------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| **A**   | False            | False            | **True**              | False                 | 1      |
| B       | **True**         | False            | **True**               | **True**               | 3      |
| C       | False            | **True**         | False                  | **True**               | 2      |
| D       | False            | False            | False                  | False                 | 0      |

Only when **A** is the culprit do we have exactly one true statement (C’s).  

Therefore, **A** must be the thief.
