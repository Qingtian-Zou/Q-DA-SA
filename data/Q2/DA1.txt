We need find consistent scenario where exactly one statement true. Let's denote statements:

S_A: "B" responsible.
S_B: "C"
S_C: either A or B (so statement is that culprit is A or B). Means at least one of A or B is culprit. Could be both? but only one culprit presumably. So S_C says culprit ∈{A,B}.
S_D: "B...or C" meaning culprit ∈{B,C}.

Only one true. Try possibilities:

If culprit = A: Then S_A false (since says B). S_B false (C). S_C true? culprit A in {A,B} yes true. S_D false (culprit not B or C). So only S_C true => works. Thus culprit A.

Check consistency: Only one truth S_C. good. So answer: A responsible.

[Answer]
Exactly one of these four statements is true.

Test each possible culprit
If A stole the chickens

A’s claim (“B”) → false
B’s claim (“C”) → false
C’s claim (“A or B”) → true (because A did it)
D’s claim (“B or C”) → false
Only C’s statement is true. ✔️

If B stole the chickens

A’s claim (“B”) → true
B’s claim (“C”) → false
C’s claim (“A or B”) → true (because B did it)
D’s claim (“B or C”) → true
Three statements would be true – impossible.

If C stole the chickens

A’s claim (“B”) → false
B’s claim (“C”) → true
C’s claim (“A or B”) → false
D’s claim (“B or C”) → true
Two statements would be true – impossible.

If D stole the chickens

None of the claims mention D, so all four would be false – also impossible.

The only scenario that satisfies “exactly one statement is true” is when A is the culprit. Thus:

A stole the chickens.
