We have a puzzle: four suspects A, B, C, D. Each makes statements about who stole chickens. Only one statement is true. We need to determine which suspect stole.

Let's formalize: Let T_X be truthfulness of each statement. Exactly one True. The content of each statement:

A says "B". So claim: culprit = B.
B says "C". Claim: culprit = C.
C says "either A or B." Means claim: culprit ∈ {A, B}. Not specifying which; could be ambiguous but the statement is that culprit is either A or B. So claim: culprit in {A,B}.
D says "B...or C" meaning culprit ∈ {B,C}.

We assume only one of these statements true. Determine who stole given that constraint.

Let culprit = X. Evaluate each statement's truth value for each possible X.

Define S_A(X) = (X==B). True if B is culprit.
S_B(X) = (X==C).
S_C(X) = (X==A or X==B).
S_D(X) = (X==B or X==C).

We need exactly one true among them.

Let's test each possible culprit:

Case 1: culprit = A. Then:
S_A(A)= false; S_B= false; S_C=true? Because A in {A,B} yes; so S_C=true. S_D false (since not B or C). So exactly one true -> Yes! That fits. So culprit could be A.

Case 2: culprit = B. Then:
S_A=true; S_B=false; S_C=true? because B in {A,B}. So true. S_D=true because B or C includes B. That's 3 truths. Not allowed.

Case 3: culprit = C. Then:
S_A false; S_B true; S_C false (C not A/B). S_D true because C is B/C. That gives two truths -> not allowed.

Case 4: culprit = D. Then none of the statements mention D. So all four are false? Let's check: S_A false, S_B false, S_C false, S_D false. That's zero truths, not one. Not allowed.

Thus only case with exactly one truth is culprit = A. Therefore A stole chickens.

But we must double-check assumption that "only one of these people is telling the truth" refers to the statements made by A,B,C,D. Yes.

So answer: A did it.

However check for nuance: C's statement: "It's either A or B. I'm not sure which..." That could be interpreted as ambiguous but still a single statement. We considered it true if culprit in {A, B}. Good.

Also D says "B...or C" meaning B or C. So same.

Thus solution: A is guilty.

But we must ensure no other interpretation yields exactly one truth. Let's examine alternative reading: maybe each person might be telling the truth about who did it, but they are all pointing fingers at each other. The puzzle states: "Only one of these people is telling the truth." So exactly one suspect is honest; the others lie. So we found that only A being culprit yields C true, B false etc. Wait hold on: if A stole chickens, then:

A's statement: "It's B who's to blame!" That would be false (since culprit A). B's: "C's the culprit." False. C's: "It's either A or B." True because A is culprit. D's: "B...or C" false.

Thus exactly one truth: C is telling truth. So it's consistent: only C is truthful, others lie. Good.

But could there be scenario where more than one statement true? Already considered.

Hence answer: The chickens were stolen by A. Alternatively if we misinterpret D's statement "B...or C" meaning maybe he says B or C but not both; still same set. So no change.

Thus final answer: A did it.

We should provide explanation step-by-step.

Let's craft final response: Only one person telling truth implies exactly one of those statements true. Evaluate each possible culprit.

Provide reasoning and conclusion.

Also mention that if D's statement is ambiguous but not "or" meaning exclusive? But still would be same set because if C stole chickens, D's statement would be true regardless of exclusivity. So still two truths.

Ok produce final answer.

# Answer

**The culprit is A.**

### How to see it

Let the four statements be:

| Person | Statement | What it claims |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **A**  | “It’s B.” | Culprit = B |
| **B**  | “C.”      | Culprit = C |
| **C**  | “Either A or B.” | Culprit ∈ {A, B} |
| **D**  | “B…or C.” | Culprit ∈ {B, C} |

Only one of these statements can be true.

We test each possible culprit and count how many statements would then be true.

---

#### 1. Culprit = A  
- A’s claim (B) → **false**  
- B’s claim (C) → false  
- C’s claim (A or B) → **true** (because the culprit is A)  
- D’s claim (B or C) → false  

Only one statement is true – that of **C**. This satisfies the puzzle.

#### 2. Culprit = B  
- A: true  
- B: false  
- C: true (B is allowed)  
- D: true (B or C)

Three statements would be true – not allowed.

#### 3. Culprit = C  
- A: false  
- B: **true**  
- C: false (C isn’t A or B)  
- D: **true**  

Two statements would be true – not allowed.

#### 4. Culprit = D  
None of the statements mention D, so all four are false – zero truths, also impossible.

---

Only one scenario gives exactly one truthful statement: **A stole the chickens**.  
In that case C is the only honest person; everyone else lies.
