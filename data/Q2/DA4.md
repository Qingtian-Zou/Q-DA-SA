Alright, let's see here. The farmer found his chicken coop door open, chickens missing, and four suspects: A, B, C, D. Each makes an accusation, but only one is telling the truth. I need to figure out who's actually responsible based on their statements.

First, let me list out each person's statement:

- **A** says it's B.
- **B** claims it's C.
- **C** points to either A or B, not sure which.
- **D** insists it's either B or C.

Only one of them is truthful. So the key here is that exactly three people are lying, and one is telling the truth. My job is to check each scenario where each suspect is guilty and see which scenario results in only one truthful statement.

Let's consider each possibility step by step.

**Case 1: Suppose A is responsible.**
- If A did it, then B's chicken (C) would be lying? Wait, no. Let's analyze each statement:

- **A's statement**: "It's B..." Since A is guilty, this is a lie. That's okay because we expect only one truthful person.
- **B's statement**: "C's the culprit." If A did it, then C didn't do it, so B is lying.
- **C's statement**: "Either A or B." If A did it, then C is telling the truth here. But wait, that would mean both A and C are truthful? Wait no, if A is guilty, then C's accusation (either A or B) is true because it's actually A. So in this case, C is telling the truth. Then we have two people telling the truth: A and C? That can't be right. But wait, hold on—if only one person is truthful, but if A is guilty, then both A's statement would be a lie (since he's blaming B), and C's statement would be true (because it's either A or B). So that already gives us two people telling the truth: C and... Wait, no. If A did it, then:

- A lied.
- B also lied because they accused C.
- C told the truth by saying it's A or B.
- D says it's B or C. Since it's actually A, D is lying.

So in this case, only C is telling the truth. But wait, if that's true, then there's exactly one truthful person (C), so that would mean the scenario where A is guilty requires only C to be truthful. However, but hold on—if A is responsible, does that make any of the other statements accidentally true? Let's check again.

- If A did it:

  - **A** says B: lie.
  
  - **B** says C: lie.
  
  - **C** says "either A or B": since it's actually A, this is a truthful statement. So C is telling the truth here.
  
  - **D** says "B or C": also lying because it was A.

So in this case, only C is truthful. But wait, does that fit with the problem? The problem states that only one person is telling the truth. If that's possible, then maybe A could be guilty. However, let me check other possibilities to see if there's a contradiction or another scenario where exactly one is truthful.

**Case 2: Suppose B is responsible.**

- **A's statement**: "It's B..." So this would be true.
  
- **B's own accusation**: But wait, if B did it, then B's statement ("C's the culprit") is a lie.
  
- **C's statement**: "Either A or B." If it's B, then C is also telling the truth here. Because either A or B would make C's statement true.
  
- **D's statement**: "It's B or C." Since it was B, D is truthful.

So in this scenario:

- Both A and D are telling the truth (A says B, which is correct; D also includes B as an option). But that's two people telling the truth. However, we can only have one. So if B were guilty, there would be at least two truths: A and C and/or D? Wait:

Wait, let's break it down step by step.

If B did it:

- **A** says "It's B" → True.

- **B** says "C's the culprit" → False (since it's B).

- **C** says "Either A or B." Since it's B, this is true. So C is truthful.

- **D** says "B or C," which includes both, so D is also telling the truth.

Thus, three people are telling the truth: A, C, and D. That's way more than one. Therefore, if B were guilty, multiple people would be truthful. Hence, B can't be responsible because it leads to too many truths.

**Case 3: Suppose C is responsible.**

- **A's statement**: "It's B." Since it's actually C, A lies.
  
- **B's statement**: "C's the culprit." If it's C, then B tells the truth here.
  
- **C's own accusation**: "Either A or B." But since it was C, neither A nor B did it, so C is lying.
  
- **D's statement**: "It's B or C." Since it's actually C, D is telling the truth.

So in this case:

- **B** and **D** are truthful. That's two people. Again, more than one. So if C were guilty, both B and D would be telling the truth. Hence, invalidating that scenario because only one should be truthful. Therefore, C can't be responsible either.

Wait a minute—hold on. Let me check again:

If C is guilty:

- A lies (blaming B).

- B tells the truth (accusing C).

- C says "either A or B," which would be false since it's actually C. So C lies.

- D says "B or C." Since it was C, so yes, D's statement includes C as an option, making D truthful.

Thus, in this scenario, both B and D are telling the truth. Two people. Therefore, invalid because only one should be truthful. Hence, C can't be guilty.

**Case 4: Suppose D is responsible.**

Wait, but all four could potentially do it? The problem doesn't state that someone must have done it; it's just among A, B, C, D. But the question is to figure out who is "to blame," meaning one of them did it. So assuming only one person actually stole the chickens.

So let's check if D is guilty:

- **A's statement**: "It's B." Since it's D, this is a lie.

- **B's accusation**: "C's culprit." Again, false because it's D. So B lies.

- **C's claim**: "Either A or B." If the culprit is D, then C is lying as well (since neither A nor B did it).

- **D's statement**: Wait, but if D is responsible, does that mean they are confessing? Or is each person making an accusation about others?

Wait a second. The way the problem is phrased: "the door open and all his chickens gone! He tells the sheriff..." Then the four people (A, B, C, D) make statements accusing each other. So actually, none of them are confessing; they're blaming someone else. Therefore, if D did it, they wouldn't be making a statement about who did it—they would presumably deny or something? Wait, but in this case, all the suspects except maybe one are pointing fingers at others.

Wait, hold on. The problem says "either A, B, C or D is responsible," so only one of them actually stole the chickens. Each person (A, B, C, D) makes a statement accusing someone else. So if D did it, what would they say? But in this case, all four are making accusations except maybe none—they're all blaming others.

Wait, but according to their statements:

- A blames B

- B blames C

- C blames either A or B

- D blames B or C

So if D is guilty, they aren't confessing; they're part of the suspects. So in this scenario, none of them would be telling the truth because all are lying? Let's check:

If D did it:

- **A** says "It's B" → Lie.

- **B** says "C's culprit" → Lie (since it's D).

- **C** says "Either A or B" → Also a lie, since neither did it; actual culprit is D. Wait, but C said "either A or B," which in logic terms would mean the culprit is one of those two. If the culprit is actually someone else not mentioned (D), then C's statement is false.

- **D** says "It's B or C." Since it's D, this is also a lie because neither B nor C did it; actual culprit is D. Wait, but hold on—is D blaming either B or C? If the real culprit is someone else not named in their own accusation (D), then yes, all statements are false.

In that case, if D were guilty, everyone would be lying, meaning zero people are telling the truth. But the problem states that exactly one person is telling the truth. Therefore, this scenario doesn't work because there would be none truthful. Hence, D cannot be responsible either? Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's clarify: If D did it, then:

- A's statement (blaming B) is false.

- B's statement (blaming C) is false.

- C's accusation ("either A or B") would also be false because the culprit isn't A or B; it's D. So that's a lie.

- D's own statement: "It's B or C." Since neither did it, this is also a lie. Therefore, all four are lying. But that contradicts the condition that exactly one is telling the truth. Hence, if D were guilty, there would be zero truthful statements. Which doesn't fit. So D can't be responsible.

Wait, but hold on—maybe there's an error in my reasoning here. Let me check again:

If D did it, then all four are lying? Let's see each statement's validity:

- A says "It's B." False because it's D.

- B says "C is the culprit." False.

- C says "Either A or B." Since neither did it, this is false (because the actual culprit isn't in that set).

- D says "B or C." Again, since it's D, both are lying. So yes, all four statements are lies. Thus, zero truths told. Not possible because we need exactly one truth-teller. Therefore, D can't be guilty.

So summarizing:

- If A is guilty: Only C tells the truth (since C's statement "either A or B" would be true). But wait, if it's actually A, then yes, that's correct. So in this case, only C is truthful. That works because there's exactly one person telling the truth.

Wait a second! Earlier when I considered Case 1 where A is guilty, my initial analysis said that C's statement would make them truthful. However, but hold on—if it's actually A, then:

- **C** says "either A or B." Since it includes both possibilities (A or B), and the actual culprit is one of those two, so that's a true statement.

But wait, if only one person can be guilty, which among A or B? If C's accusation covers either/or, but we need to determine exactly who did it. However, in this case, since it's actually A, then both A and B are possible culprits according to C's statement. But the problem states that "either" is used by C as in they don't know which of the two (A or B) is responsible. So if we assume only one culprit exists, but C says "either/or," does that make their statement true regardless?

Wait, here's a key point: In logic terms, when someone says "Either X or Y" and it's actually either X or Y, then that's considered True in an exclusive OR sense? Wait no—actually, the logical connector here is ambiguous. Is C using it as inclusive OR (either one of them) or exclusive OR (either A did it alone or B did it alone)? The problem statement says "Either A or B." In common language, that usually means at least one of them is responsible, but since only one person can be guilty here, then if the culprit is either A or B, C's statement would still hold. So in this case, regardless of which one (A or B) did it, as long as it's not someone else, C's statement is true.

But wait—if we suppose that exactly one of them is responsible for all chickens being gone, then if the culprit were A, C's statement "either A or B" would still be considered True. Similarly, if it were B, same thing. But in our scenario where we're assuming it's actually A, then yes, only three lies and one truth (C). Wait, but hold on—if we take this approach:

If the culprit is someone who isn't accusing themselves? Or do they have to?

Wait, no—the problem doesn't state that anyone would accuse themselves; all are blaming others. So in any case, if A did it, then C's statement "Either A or B" includes the actual culprit (A), so that's true.

But here's a catch: If we suppose that only one person is guilty, and someone else's accusation covers both possibilities but not including anyone else except those two, does their inclusion of multiple people affect anything? For example, if it's actually D, then C's statement would be false because neither A nor B did it. But in the case where actual culprit is A or B, C's statement holds.

But since we are testing each scenario:

- **Case 1: Culprit is A**

  - Only person telling truth: C

- **Case 2: Culprit is B**

  - Persons telling truths: A and D (and maybe others?)

Wait earlier analysis said if culprit is B, then both A and D would be truthful. But that can't be.

Wait let's re-examine:

If the culprit is B:

- **A** says "It's B" → True

- **B** says "C's culprit" → False

- **C** says "Either A or B" → True (since it's B)

- **D** says "B or C" → True (since it's B)

Thus, three truths: A, C, D. Not allowed.

If the culprit is C:

- **A** lies

- **B** tells truth ("C's culprit")

- **C** lies ("either A or B", since actual is C not in that set)

- **D** tells truth ("B or C" → True because it's C)

So here, two truths: B and D. Not allowed.

If the culprit is D:

All lie. So zero truths. Invalid.

Thus, only when the culprit is A do we have exactly one person telling the truth (C). But wait a second—hold on! If culprit is A, then according to C's statement "Either A or B," since it's actually A, that makes their accusation true, so yes, that's valid. Therefore, this scenario works: only C tells the truth.

But hold on—the problem says "only one of these people is telling the truth." So if we take culprit as A, then indeed only C's statement is truthful. But let's check again:

- **A** accuses B → lie

- **B** accuses C → lie (since it's A)

- **C** accuses either A or B → true (actual is A)

- **D** accuses B or C → lies (it's A)

Thus, exactly one truthful statement from C. Therefore, this scenario works.

But wait—hold on a moment—the problem states "the door open and all his chickens gone! He tells the sheriff..." So does that mean someone else told the farmer about finding it? Or is the farmer telling the sheriff himself?

Wait no—the setup is: The farmer comes back to find the door open, chickens gone. Then he goes to the sheriff (who works out) among A, B, C, D who did it. Each of them makes a statement accusing another.

So in this case, if we have only one truth-teller, which would be C when culprit is A.

But let me check again: If culprit is A:

- **C** says "Either A or B." Since it's actually A, so that's true. So C tells the truth. The other three (A, B, D) are lying.

Yes. That fits perfectly with the condition that only one person is telling the truth.

But wait—is there another possibility where culprit is not among them? But no—the problem says "either A, B, C or D is responsible." So it's definitely one of those four.

Wait—hold on! Wait a second. If the actual culprit were someone who isn't any of these (but that contradicts the initial statement). The farmer said to the sheriff that either A, B, C, or D did it. Therefore, only among them can be guilty.

So in all cases:

- **If A is guilty**: Only C tells truth.

- **If B is guilty**: Multiple truths (A and others).

- **If C is guilty**: Two truths.

- **If D is guilty**: No truths.

Therefore, the only scenario that fits the condition of exactly one truthful statement is when culprit is A, making C the sole truth-teller. But wait—hold on! Wait a moment—is there an inconsistency here?

Wait—the problem says "only one of these people is telling the truth." If we take this approach:

- When culprit is A: Only C tells the truth.

But in that case, does it mean D's statement ("B or C") would be false because it's actually A. But if no one else except C is truthful, then that's okay. So yes, only C is telling the truth.

However, here's a possible flaw in my reasoning: If culprit is A, and we have to determine who did it based on their statements with exactly one truthful statement—this seems valid. However, there's another angle here. Let's suppose that if someone else (like D) were guilty but they aren't confessing; instead, they're also blaming others. But according to the problem setup, all four are suspects and each is making an accusation.

Wait—but in our analysis above, only when A is guilty do we get exactly one truthful statement from C. However, there's a catch here: If culprit is A, then B's statement ("C") would be false, D's statement ("B or C") would also be false, and so on. So yes, that seems okay.

But wait—is there another angle where the truthfulness depends on who actually did it?

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach: Assume each person is guilty one by one and count the number of truths.

Let's tabulate:

| Suspect | A's Statement (B) | B's Statement (C) | C's Statement (A/B) | D's Statement (B/C) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **If A**| False             | False             | True                | False                |
| **If B**| True              | False             | True                | True                 |
| **If C**| False             | True              | False               | True                 |
| **If D**| False             | False             | False               | False                |

Now, count the number of truths for each case:

- **A guilty**: Only C is truthful (1 truth).
- **B guilty**: A and C and/or D are truthful. Specifically, three people would be telling the truth.
- **C guilty**: B and D are truthful (2 truths).
- **D guilty**: All false.

Thus, only when A is guilty do we have exactly one person (C) telling the truth. Therefore, according to this table, culprit must be A, with C being the sole truth-teller.

But wait—the problem says "your name is Phi, an AI math expert developed by Microsoft." So maybe I should check once more for any possible mistakes.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the statements. For instance, when C says "either A or B," does that mean exactly one of them did it (exclusive OR), which would make their statement false if both are innocent? But in this case, we already know only one person is guilty. Wait—if culprit is D, then it's not among A/B/C/D? No—the problem states the sheriff knows it's one of A, B, C, or D.

Wait no, back to logic: If someone says "Either X or Y," and in reality both are innocent but neither did it (so Z), does that make their statement false?

Yes. For example:

- If culprit is D, then C's accusation ("either A or B") would be a lie because the actual culprit isn't either of them.

Similarly, if the culprit were someone else not among those four—but no, per problem setup, it's one of these four.

But in our cases above, we've already considered all possibilities where culprit is A, B, C, D. So only when culprit is A do we have exactly one truth-teller (C).

Wait—hold on! There's a mistake here. If the actual culprit is A, then:

- **A** says "It's B." That's false.

- **B** says "C's culprit." False.

- **C** says "Either A or B." True, since it's actually A.

- **D** says "B or C." False.

Thus, only C tells the truth. So this works.

But here's a catch: In logic terms, if someone accuses either X or Y and it turns out to be one of them (X or Y), does that make their statement true? Yes, because they accused at least one from those two. Even though both aren't necessarily innocent; only the actual culprit is guilty among A or B.

But since exactly one person did it in total, if it's A, then C's accusation covers the real culprit but not D. But according to our earlier analysis, this works.

Therefore, based on all cases:

Only when the culprit is **A** does exactly one statement (C) hold true. Thus, the answer should be that A is responsible? Wait—no! Wait, no. Because if C's accusation leads us to conclude it's either A or B, but we know only one person did it. So how can both accusations lead to truth?

Wait—the problem here is in our logic: If culprit is A, then C's statement "Either A or B" would indeed be true because the actual culprit falls under that category. However, this doesn't mean multiple people are telling the truth; it's just one person's accusation includes the real culprit.

But according to the statements:

- Only if exactly one's accusations match reality do they tell the truth.

So in the case of A being guilty:

- **A's statement**: False (accuses B).

- **B's statement**: False (accuses C).

- **C's statement**: True (accuses either A or B, which includes real culprit A).

- **D's statement**: False (accuses B or C, but it's A).

Thus, only one truth-teller. Therefore, the conclusion is that C is telling the truth when A did it. Wait—no! The question asks "Who is to blame?" So if in this scenario where culprit is A, then who is blaming?

But according to their statements:

- **A** blames B.

- **B** blames C.

- **C** accuses either A or B.

- **D** blames B or C.

So the actual culprit would be someone. If it's actually A (the one we're considering), then who is blaming?

But in this case, no one except possibly D? Wait—no. All accusations are about others:

Wait—the problem states "either A, B, C or D is responsible," so each of them could be the one.

So if culprit is A, none of them actually admit to it; instead, they blame someone else. So in this case:

- **A** blames B.

- **B** blames C.

- **C** says it's either A or B.

- **D** says it's B or C.

Thus, the actual culprit is not any of these four? But wait—the problem states that one of them must be responsible. So if we're considering scenario where culprit is someone among A-D, then:

If culprit is A (even though he's blaming B), but according to his own statement ("It's B"), which would be a lie.

But the key point here is not who they are accusing but whether their statements align with reality.

So in this case, if actual culprit is A, only C's accusation aligns because it's either A or B. Therefore, C tells the truth, others don't. Thus, that works.

Therefore, according to all analysis, when **A** is guilty, there's exactly one truthful statement from **C**. Hence, that's the solution.

But wait—I need to check if this holds water with another angle. Let's suppose A did it:

- The farmer finds chickens missing and four suspects: A, B, C, D.

- Each accuses someone else.

- Only one is telling the truth.

If only **C** tells the truth by saying it's either A or B (which includes himself), then that's valid because his statement doesn't specify exactly who but covers both possibilities. Thus, since it turned out to be A, which falls under C's accusation, he was truthful.

But here's a possible contradiction: If C is telling the truth that "either A or B" did it, and we later find it's actually A, does that mean only one person (C) told the truth? Yes. Because:

- **A** lied by blaming B.

- **B** also lied by blaming C.

- **D** lied by accusing B or C.

- Only **C** was correct in his accusation covering both possibilities where it actually is A.

Therefore, this scenario fits perfectly with only one truthful statement.

But wait a moment—could there be an alternative interpretation of "either/or"? For instance, if the sheriff interprets "either" as exclusive OR (i.e., exactly one of them), then C's statement would require that it's either A or B but not both. But since we know there's only one culprit anyway, this wouldn't affect much because even in exclusive OR terms, it still holds.

Alternatively, maybe someone else's accusation is true by default if the actual culprit isn't accusing themselves? No—because D could be guilty and accuse others (B or C), which doesn't involve himself.

But according to our analysis earlier:

- Only when A is guilty do we get exactly one truth-teller (C).

Therefore, this must be the case. So the answer should be that **A** did it, with only **C** telling the truth.

Wait, no! Wait—the question asks "Who is to blame?" If in our analysis the culprit is A, then that's the answer. But let me just confirm once more:

If culprit is A:

- Only C's statement ("Either A or B") is true because it's actually A.

Thus, only C tells the truth; hence, others are lying. This fits perfectly with the problem's condition of exactly one truthful person.

Therefore, based on this reasoning, **A** must be to blame.

Wait—hold on! Wait a second—I just realized something critical here. If culprit is A, then D's statement ("B or C") would also include someone else not involved in any other statements? No—D accuses B or C. But if the real culprit is A, which isn't mentioned by anyone except maybe... but no one mentions A directly.

Wait—the key point here is that all four are accusing others; none of them admit to their own guilt (except perhaps D indirectly). Wait:

Looking at each person's statement:

- **A** accuses B.

- **B** accuses C.

- **C** doesn't accuse themselves, says either A or B.

- **D** also doesn't accuse anyone except B and C.

So if the real culprit is A, then none of them are confessing; all are accusing others. Therefore, when D makes a statement about "B or C," since it's actually A, that's false.

Similarly, C's accusation covers either A or B—so even though they include themselves in their own accusation? Wait no:

**C's statement is:** "Either A or B." So they're saying the culprit is one of those two. Since there's only one culprit (A), then if it's actually A, this works.

But here's an important consideration: If C says "either A or B," does that mean they could be implicating both? But since there can only be one culprit, even though their statement includes multiple possibilities, as long as the actual culprit falls within those options, their accusation is true.

Thus, with all considerations in mind, when **A** did it:

- Only C's accusation ("Either A or B") matches reality (it's actually A), making that truthful.

All others are lying. Therefore, this satisfies the condition of exactly one truth-teller.

Therefore, after careful analysis and checking each possibility exhaustively, the conclusion is that **A** is responsible for the chickens going missing.

# Answer

The key to solving the problem lies in evaluating which scenario results in only one person telling the truth. By systematically analyzing each suspect's statement under different guilt conditions:

1. **If A were guilty**, C's statement ("Either A or B") would be true, while all others (A, B, D) would lie. This satisfies the condition of exactly one truthful speaker.
2. **If any other party (B, C, or D)** were guilty, multiple people would end up telling the truth, which contradicts the given constraint.

Thus, the only valid scenario is when **A** did it, making **C** the sole truth-teller.

\boxed{A}
