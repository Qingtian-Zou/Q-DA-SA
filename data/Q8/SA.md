As the question says, the important properties of petals are their shapes and colors.
Keeping this in mind, let's have a look at all the petals:

| Color\Shape | Sword-tip | Round | Double-round | Triple-tip |
| ----------- | --------- | ----- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Blue        | 6         | 1     | -            | 2          |
| Red         | -         | -     | -            | 3          |
| Green       | -         | 5     | 8            | 4          |
| Orange      | 7         | -     | 9            | -          |
| Purple      | -         | -     | 10           | -          |

Numbers indicate petals' labels.
As the question instructs, the blue round petal on the top is petal 1, and the blue sword-tip petal on the bottom is petal 6.

Looking at this table, there are two rows that are different from others.
There is only one red petal and one purple petal.
This means that these two petals have to be surrounded by petals of the same shape because they have no other petals of the same color.
Therefore, we have two subsequence: [8, 10, 9] and [2, 3, 4], or their reverse order.
Next, let's try expanding these two sub-sequences.

Looking at petal 9, it can only be adjacent to petal 7, which is the only petal of the same color, because other petals of the same shape have all been selected.
Similarly, petal 7 can only be adjacent to petal 6.
Therefore, subsequence [8, 10, 9] is expanded to [8, 10, 9, 7, 6],
The remaining petals are 1 and 5, and their task is to glue subsequences [8, 10, 9, 7, 6] and [2, 3, 4].
Now, from the table, it is clear that petal 1 can glue petals 2 and 6 because they are of the same color, and petal 5 can glue petals 8 and 4.
Therefore, we have the final sequence as follows:
> 8 -> 10 -> 9 -> 7 -> 6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> (loop back) 8

Of course, the reverse order also satisfies the requirements:
> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 9 -> 10 -> 8 -> (loop back) 5
