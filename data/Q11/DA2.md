# Thinking

Okay, let's try to figure out where to cut this necklace so that breaking it into three parts results in each part having equal value. Hmm, first off, the total value of all the stones needs to be divisible by 3 because we want three strands each worth the same amount. Let me add up all those numbers.

Let me list them again: 900, 1200, 100, 500, 800, 1100, 200, 400, 300, 600, 1000, 700. Wait, how many stones is that? Let's count: 900 (1), 1200 (2), 100 (3), 500 (4), 800 (5), 1100 (6), 200 (7), 400 (8), 300 (9), 600 (10), 1000 (11), 700 (12). So twelve stones total. The problem says it's a necklace, so the last stone loops back to the first.

Let me add them step by step:

Start with 900 + 1200 = 2100

2100 + 100 = 2200

2200 + 500 = 2700

2700 + 800 = 3500

3500 + 1100 = 4600

4600 + 200 = 4800

4800 + 400 = 5200

5200 + 300 = 5500

5500 + 600 = 6100

6100 + 1000 = 7100

7100 + 700 = 7800

Wait, total is 7800? Hmm. Let me verify that addition again because it's easy to make a mistake here.

Let's list all the numbers:

900

1200 (sum so far: 2100)

100 (2200)

500 (2700)

800 (3500)

1100 (4600)

200 (4800)

400 (5200)

300 (5500)

600 (6100)

1000 (7100)

700 (7800). Yeah, that's right. So total is 7800.

So each strand should be worth 7800 / 3 = 2600. Wait, 2600? Hmm, but the individual stones are all different and some are over 1000. Let me check: 7800 divided by 3 is indeed 2600.

So we need to split the necklace into three continuous segments (since it's a circle) each adding up to 2600. But since it's a necklace, breaking it at three places will give three separate strands that are each linear sequences connecting the breaks. Wait, actually, when you break a necklace in three places, you get three separate strands? Or does it make three segments?

Wait, the problem says: "if I break the necklace in three places, the three gem strands will be worth the same amount as one another." So breaking at three places would split the circle into three linear strands. Each strand is a consecutive sequence of stones from the breaks.

So we need to find three starting points such that each segment (which is a consecutive set on the necklace) sums to 2600, and since it's a circular necklace, these segments will not overlap and cover all stones.

But since it's circular, we can fix one break point and look for two more. Hmm, but maybe there are multiple solutions? The problem says "where you gotta cut it", so probably unique solution.

Wait, the key here is that it's a circle, so the necklace has no beginning or end. So we need to find three points where cutting will divide it into three arcs each summing to 2600.

Given that total is 7800, each segment must be 2600.

So first step: confirm the total is indeed 7800. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here?

Wait let's add again:

900 + 1200 = 2100

+100 = 2200

+500 = 2700

+800 = 3500

+1100 = 4600

+200 = 4800

+400 = 5200

+300 = 5500

+600 = 6100

+1000 = 7100

+700 = 7800. Hmm, okay.

So each segment needs to sum to 2600.

We need to find three points where starting from a point and moving clockwise, the sums hit 2600, then another 2600, etc., but since it's circular, we have to be careful.

This is similar to finding three cyclic substrings each with sum 2600.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of prefix sums in a circular array.

Let me try to list the stones in order:

1: 900

2: 1200

3: 100

4: 500

5: 800

6: 1100

7: 200

8: 400

9: 300

10: 600

11: 1000

12: 700

Then back to 1: 900.

We need to find three starting points such that each segment sums to 2600.

Let me try to compute cumulative sums, but since it's circular, maybe fix a point as the start and then look for two more segments.

Alternatively, let's consider the problem on a linear array by duplicating the list (to handle circularity), so we have stones 1-12 followed by 1-12 again. Then find three contiguous segments each summing to 2600, non-overlapping, covering exactly 12 elements.

But since it's a circle, maybe overlapping isn't an issue here? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another idea: If we can find two points where the cumulative sum from a starting point reaches 2600, then another 5200 (i.e., two segments), etc. But given circularity.

Alternatively, let's create a prefix sum array for the linearized necklace (assuming start at stone 1).

Let me try that.

Define S[0] = 0

S[1] = 900

S[2] = 900 + 1200 = 2100

S[3] = 2100 + 100 = 2200

S[4] = 2200 + 500 = 2700

S[5] = 2700 + 800 = 3500

S[6] = 3500 + 1100 = 4600

S[7] = 4600 + 200 = 4800

S[8] = 4800 + 400 = 5200

S[9] = 5200 + 300 = 5500

S[10] = 5500 + 600 = 6100

S[11] = 6100 + 1000 = 7100

S[12] = 7100 + 700 = 7800

Then S[13] would be S[12] + 900 = 7800 + 900 = 8700, etc.

But since it's circular, the cumulative sums can wrap around. Hmm, tricky.

The idea is that for each starting point i, we want to find a j > i such that S[j] - S[i] = 2600, and then another k > j such that S[k] - S[j] = 2600, and finally from k back to i (wrapping around) the sum is also 2600.

But with 12 elements, maybe it's feasible to check all possibilities.

Alternatively, since the total is 7800, we can look for two different cumulative sums that are equal modulo 2600? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: For each stone as a starting point, compute the running sum until it hits 2600. If we do this for all starting points, we might find segments.

Let's try starting from stone 1 (value 900):

Start at 1:

Current sum = 0

Add 900: 900 < 2600

Add 1200: 2100 < 2600

Add 100: 2200 < 2600

Add 500: 2700 > 2600. Hmm, so segment from 1 to 4 (stones 1-4) sum to 2700 which is over.

Wait, but we need exactly 2600.

Hmm. Maybe this trial and error isn't the best way.

Wait, let's list all the cumulative sums S[n] as above:

n : value : S[n]
0 : -      : 0
1 : 900    : 900
2 : 1200   : 2100
3 : 100    : 2200
4 : 500    : 2700
5 : 800    : 3500
6 : 1100   : 4600
7 : 200    : 4800
8 : 400    : 5200
9 : 300    : 5500
10: 600    : 6100
11: 1000   : 7100
12: 700    : 7800

So S[12] = 7800.

If we consider the circular nature, then a segment from stone i to j (mod 12) has sum equal to S[j] - S[i-1] if we do linear. Wait, maybe better to index properly.

Assume that prefix sums S[k] is the sum of stones 1 through k.

So the sum from stone a to stone b inclusive is S[b] - S[a-1].

Given that, in order to get a segment summing to 2600 starting at some stone i (i from 1 to 12), we need to find j such that S[j] - S[i-1] = 2600.

But since it's circular, if the segment wraps around, then the sum would be S[12] - S[i-1] + S[j] (for j < i).

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternative idea: Let's look for two points where cumulative sums differ by 2600. Since total is 7800, we need three segments each of 2600, so if we can find a starting point such that the cumulative sum hits 2600 at some point, then another 5200, etc.

Wait, here's an idea: If we consider all the prefix sums (from S[0] to S[12]), and look for pairs of indices where their difference is 2600. But because it's circular, we have to account for wrap-around.

But given that total sum is 7800, then S[n] + something = 7800.

Wait, let's list all the prefix sums:

S[0] = 0

S[1] = 900

S[2] = 2100

S[3] = 2200

S[4] = 2700

S[5] = 3500

S[6] = 4600

S[7] = 4800

S[8] = 5200

S[9] = 5500

S[10] = 6100

S[11] = 7100

S[12] = 7800

Now, in a circular necklace, if we have three segments each summing to 2600, then the prefix sums should have three points where they are offset by 2600. However, due to circularity, it's a bit different.

Wait, another approach: Let's assume that after breaking at three places, each segment is a consecutive sequence. So starting from some point A, we go clockwise and collect stones until sum=2600, then from there another 2600, then the last 2600 which wraps around.

To model this, let's consider all possible segments:

We can look for values in S[1..12] (the prefix sums) that are equal to some value mod 2600? Not sure.

Wait, if we have a segment from stone i+1 to j, its sum is S[j] - S[i]. So we need S[j] - S[i] = 2600 for each segment.

Therefore, looking for pairs (i,j) where S[j] = S[i] + 2600.

Similarly, the next segment would be from stone j+1 to k with sum 2600: S[k] - S[j] = 2600 => S[k] = S[j] + 2600

And finally the last segment from k+1 back to i (wrapping around) would need sum 2600: total sum - (S[k] - S[i])? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, in a circular arrangement, if we have three segments:

Segment 1: stones from a to b inclusive

Segment 2: stones from b+1 to c inclusive

Segment 3: stones from c+1 to a-1 inclusive (wrapping around)

Each segment sums to 2600.

So S[b] - S[a-1] = 2600

S[c] - S[b] = 2600 => S[c] = S[b] + 2600

Total sum from c+1 to a-1: S[12] + S[a-1] - S[c] = 7800 + S[a-1] - S[c] ?

Wait, maybe better not to get confused.

Let me try specific values.

Looking at the prefix sums:

We need to find three indices i < j < k such that:

S[j] - S[i] = 2600

S[k] - S[j] = 2600

and (7800 + S[i]) - S[k] = 2600 => 7800 - (S[k] - S[i]) = 2600. Wait, since the last segment wraps around.

Wait, the total sum is 7800 = sum of all segments. Each segment is 2600, so:

If segment1: from i+1 to j => sum = S[j]-S[i] = 2600

segment2: j+1 to k => sum = S[k]-S[j] = 2600

segment3: k+1 to i => sum = (total sum) - (S[k]-S[i]) = 7800 - (S[k]-S[i])

But since it should equal 2600,

7800 - (S[k] - S[i]) = 2600 => S[k] - S[i] = 5200

Which is equivalent to S[k] = S[i] + 5200.

Given that S[k] must be <= 7800 (since S[12]=7800), then S[i] + 5200 <= 7800 => S[i] <= 2600.

Similarly, from the first two segments:

S[j] = S[i] + 2600

S[k] = S[j] + 2600 = S[i] + 5200

So we need three prefix sums: S[i], S[i]+2600, S[i]+5200.

We can look in the list of prefix sums (including possibly wrapping around?) Wait, but our prefix sums go up to 7800.

Let's check which values are present:

Looking at the S array:

S[0] = 0

S[1] = 900

S[2] = 2100

S[3] = 2200

S[4] = 2700

S[5] = 3500

S[6] = 4600

S[7] = 4800

S[8] = 5200

S[9] = 5500

S[10] = 6100

S[11] = 7100

S[12] = 7800

So let's see if there exists an S[i] such that S[i], S[i]+2600, S[i]+5200 are all in the list (with possible wrap? But since we're dealing with linear prefix sums here, maybe not).

Let's check each S[i]:

Start with S[0] = 0:

Check if 0 + 2600 = 2600 exists? Looking at S: no. Next, 5200? S[8]=5200. Hmm.

Wait S[8] = 5200.

If i=0: S[i]=0

We need S[j] = 2600 (not present)

S[k] = 5200 (present at index 8)

But since we need S[j] to be 2600 which isn't there, this fails.

Next:

Check S[1] = 900

Looking for 900 + 2600 = 3500. Which is S[5] = 3500. Good.

Then 900 + 5200 = 6100, which is S[10] = 6100. Perfect!

Wait a second, this seems promising.

So:

S[i] = S[1] = 900

S[j] = S[5] = 3500 (which is 900 + 2600)

S[k] = S[10] = 6100 (which is 900 + 5200)

So according to this:

The segments would be:

From i+1 = 2 to j = 5: stones 2,3,4,5

Sum: S[5]-S[1] = 3500 - 900 = 2600. Correct.

Then from j+1 =6 to k=10: stones 6,7,8,9,10

Sum: S[10]-S[5] = 6100 - 3500 = 2600. Correct.

Then the last segment wraps around from k+1=11 to i-1=0 (which is stone 12 and then back to stone 1?)

Wait, need to be careful with indexing.

Assuming that prefix sums S[n] is sum of first n stones (S[0]=0, S[1] = stone1, etc.)

So the segment from i+1 to j corresponds to stones starting at position i+1 up to j.

If we have:

i = 1 (since S[i] = S[1]), so stone i is stone 1.

Wait, this might be confusing.

Let me clarify:

In prefix sum notation:

S[n] = value of stone 1 + ... + stone n

Therefore, the sum from stone a to stone b inclusive is S[b] - S[a-1]

So if we have a segment starting at stone x and ending at stone y (inclusive), its sum is S[y] - S[x-1]

In our previous example:

We found that S[5] = 3500, which is S[i] + 2600 where i=1 (S[1]=900). So:

S[j] - S[i] = 2600 => j=5, i=1.

Therefore, the segment sum from stone i+1 (stone 2) to stone j (stone5): stones 2,3,4,5

Sum: S[5] - S[1] = 3500 - 900 = 2600. Correct.

Next segment: from stone j+1=6 to k where S[k] = S[j] + 2600 = 3500 + 2600 = 6100, which is S[10]. So segment sum from stone6 to stone10: S[10]-S[5] = 6100 - 3500 = 2600.

Then the last segment should be from stone11 to stone1 (wrapping around), since after stone10 comes stone11, then stone12, then back to stone1.

Wait, let's compute its sum:

Total sum is 7800. Sum of first two segments: 2600*2=5200. Therefore the last segment must be 2600.

Sum from stone11 to stone12 and stone1? Wait:

Stones after k+1 = 10 + 1 =11:

Stone11: 1000

Stone12:700

Then wrap around to stone1:900?

Wait, no. Wait the necklace is circular. The three segments are:

1. Stones 2-5 (sums to 2600)

2. Stones 6-10 (sums to 2600)

3. Stones 11,12, and then... Wait, stone1?

Wait, stones from k+1 =11 to i=1 (wrapping around). Since i was originally S[i] where i=1 corresponds to prefix sum after stone1.

Hmm, this indexing is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, the three segments would be:

- Segment 1: starting at position 2, length 4 stones (2,3,4,5)

- Segment 2: starting at position6, length5 stones (6,7,8,9,10)

- Segment3: remaining stones:11,12, and then wrap to start?

Wait stone numbers:

Total stones: 12.

Segments:

Segment1: stones 2,3,4,5 (4 stones)

Segment2: stones6,7,8,9,10 (5 stones)

So remaining stones: 11,12,1? Wait, no. If we have a circle, after stone10 comes stone11.

Wait, the three segments should be non-overlapping and cover all stones.

If segment1 is 4 stones (2-5), segment2 is 5 stones (6-10), then remaining are stones 11,12, and 1? Wait no:

From stone1 to stone12.

If you take stones 2-5: that's 4 stones

Stones6-10: 5 stones

Total so far:9 stones. Remaining: 3 stones (11,12,1). Yes.

So segment3 should be stones11,12,1.

Let's check the sum:

Stone11:1000

Stone12:700

Stone1:900

Sum:1000 + 700 + 900 = 2600. Perfect!

So that works.

Therefore, breaking the necklace at the ends of each segment would be after stone5 and after stone10, and then after stone1 (wrapping around).

But when you break a necklace to make three strands, you need to cut at three places. Each cut is between two stones.

To get segments:

- Between stone5 and stone6

- Between stone10 and stone11

- Between stone12 and stone1?

Wait, let's think carefully.

In order to have segment1 as stones2-5, the break points would be before stone2 (so after stone1) and after stone5.

Similarly, segment2 ends at stone10, so cut after stone10; segment3 starts at stone11, so cut after stone12 (which connects back to stone1).

Wait, maybe it's better:

To get a strand from stone A to stone B, you need to cut just before A and just after B.

Since the necklace is circular, cutting three places will divide it into three strands.

In this case:

- First strand: stones 2,3,4,5. So cuts are between stone1 & stone2, and between stone5 & stone6

- Second strand: stones6,7,8,9,10. Cuts between stone5&6 (already considered), stone10&11

Wait no, perhaps:

If you cut at three places: after stone5, after stone10, and after stone12 (which is equivalent to before stone1).

So the three cuts are:

After stone5 (between 5 and6)

After stone10 (between10 and11)

After stone12 (between12 and1)

This would create three strands:

- Stones1 to5? No, wait.

Wait no. If you cut after stone5, then the first strand is from stone6 onward? Hmm, confusion reigns.

Alternative way: When you have a circle, cutting at three points will give three linear segments. Each segment is between two cuts.

So if we make cuts between:

- Stone X and Y

- Stone Z and W

- Stone V and U

Then the strands are:

Y to Z

W to V

U to X

But maybe better to use an example.

Given that we have three segments:

1. Stones 2,3,4,5 (sum 2600)

2. Stones6,7,8,9,10 (sum2600)

3. Stones11,12,1 (sum2600)

To get these segments, we need to cut the necklace at:

After stone1 and after stone5: no.

Wait, if the strand starts at 2, then you must have a cut before 2 (i.e., between 1 and2) and after 5 (between5 and6).

Similarly, second strand starts at6, so cut between5 and6 and between10 and11.

Third strand starts at11, so cut between10 and11 and between12 and1.

Wait, three cuts: between5-6, between10-11, and between12-1.

Yes, that would split the necklace into:

- From 6 to10 (inclusive): stones6-10

- From11 to12 and then back to1? Wait no.

Wait, if you cut after5 (between5-6), after10 (between10-11), and after12 (between12-1), then the three strands are:

1. Starting at6, ending at10

2. Starting at11, ending at12

3. Starting at1, ending at5

Wait no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, when you make a cut between two stones, it's like removing those connections.

Imagine the necklace as a circle with 12 beads numbered 1-12 clockwise.

If we make three cuts:

- Between bead5 and bead6

- Between bead10 and bead11

- Between bead12 and bead1

Then the three strands are:

Strand1: beads6,7,8,9,10 (between cut after5 and cut after10)

Strand2: beads11,12 (between cut after10 and cut after12)

Wait, that's only two beads. Hmm, no.

Wait, actually each strand is a continuous sequence between two cuts.

So:

After cutting at three places, you have three separate loops? No, the problem says "the three gem strands", so they are linear strands (not circular), meaning the necklace is broken into three straight strands by making three cuts, each cut separating one strand from another.

Wait, maybe it's like this: To make a necklace into three strands, you cut it at three points which are not adjacent, thereby creating three separate chains. Each chain is a continuous segment of the original necklace.

For example, imagine a circle with dots 1-12 clockwise. If we cut between 5 and6, between10 and11, and between12 and1 (which is equivalent to cutting after bead12), then you get three strands:

- From bead6 to bead10: beads6,7,8,9,10

- From bead11 to bead12: beads11,12

Wait, no, that's only two beads. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, actually, each cut disconnects the necklace into strands. If you make three cuts on a circular necklace, it becomes three separate linear strands (each strand has two ends where the cuts were made).

Therefore, the length of each strand corresponds to the number of stones between two consecutive cuts.

Given that, our segments:

To get a strand of stones2-5: needs to have a cut before stone2 and after stone5

Similarly:

Strand1: stones2,3,4,5 (length 4)

Cut at: after stone1 (before 2) and after stone5 (between5-6)

Strand2: stones6,7,8,9,10 (length5)

Cut at: after stone5 and after stone10

Strand3: stones11,12,1 (length3)

Cut at: after stone10, after stone12, and after stone1 (which connects back to start)

Wait, this is getting too tangled.

But according to the sums we found:

- Segment sum 2600: stones2-5

- Segment sum 2600: stones6-10

- Segment sum 2600: stones11,12,1

So these three segments each sum to 2600.

Therefore, the cuts needed are between stone1 and stone2 (to separate strand starting at2), between stone5 and stone6 (end of first strand), between stone10 and stone11 (end of second strand), and then... Wait no, three cuts total.

Ah! Here's the key: To divide a circle into n strands with n cuts. So three cuts make three strands.

Each cut is between two stones. So we need to choose three distinct gaps between stones where cutting will produce three strands each having the desired sum.

The gaps are:

Gap1: between stone12 and stone1

Gap2: between stone1 and stone2

Gap3: between stone2 and stone3

...

Gap12: between stone11 and stone12

So, we need to choose three gaps such that the stones between each pair of consecutive gaps sum to 2600.

In our solution:

Strand1 (stones2-5) is between Gap2 (after1) and Gap6 (after5)

Strand2 (stones6-10) is between Gap6 (after5) and Gap11 (after10)

Strand3 (stones11,12,1) is between Gap11 (after10) and Gap1 (after12)

Wait, the three gaps we cut are Gap2, Gap6, Gap11.

Because:

- Cutting at Gap2: after stone1

- Cutting at Gap6: after stone5

- Cutting at Gap11: after stone10

This would result in three strands:

From Gap2 to Gap6: stones2-5 (4 stones)

From Gap6 to Gap11: stones6-10 (5 stones)

From Gap11 back to Gap2: stones11,12,1 (3 stones)

Yes! Exactly.

So the three cuts are after stone1 (gap between 1 and2), after stone5 (between5 and6), and after stone10 (between10 and11). So cutting at those three gaps.

But the problem says "break the necklace in three places". Each break is a place where you cut, so it's equivalent to cutting at three gaps. The question asks: "where you gotta cut it".

The answer should specify which stones to cut between.

Given that the original list of values loops back (stone12 connects to stone1), we can describe the cuts as follows:

Cut after 1st stone (between stone1 and2)

Cut after 5th stone (between5 and6)

Cut after 10th stone (between10 and11)

But depending on how they want it phrased.

Wait, let me confirm once more.

Stones in order with their values:

1:900

2:1200

3:100

4:500

5:800

6:1100

7:200

8:400

9:300

10:600

11:1000

12:700

So cutting after stone1 (between 1 and2), after stone5 (between5 and6), and after stone10 (between10 and11).

This creates:

- First strand: stones2,3,4,5 sum to 1200 + 100 + 500 +800 = 2600 ✔️

Second strand: stones6,7,8,9,10: 1100 +200 +400 +300 +600 = 2600 ✔️ (1100+200=1300; +400=1700; +300=2000; +600=2600)

Third strand: stones11,12,1: 1000 +700 +900 =2600 ✔️

Perfect! So these three cuts work.

Therefore, the answer is to cut between stone1 and stone2, stone5 and stone6, and stone10 and stone11.

But how does the problem want it phrased? "Where you gotta cut it".

Probably they want to say after which stones or between which numbers.

Since each stone is numbered in order as given: 900 (stone1), 1200 (stone2), ..., 700 (stone12).

So cutting after the first stone, fifth stone, and tenth stone.

But depending on if they count starting at 1.

Wait, another check:

Stone numbers:

1:900

2:1200

3:100

4:500

5:800

6:1100

7:200

8:400

9:300

10:600

11:1000

12:700

So cutting after stone 1 (between 1 and 2), after stone5, after stone10.

The problem says "break the necklace in three places". Each break is a place between two stones. So the answer should specify which pairs to cut between.

The user might want the answer as: cut between the 1st and 2nd gem, 5th and 6th gem, and 10th and 11th gem.

But let's see if there are other solutions.

Wait, we found one solution. Could there be another?

Let me check.

For example, suppose we look for S[i] = 2200 (S[3])

2200 + 2600 = 4800 (exists at S[7])

4800 + 2600 = 7400. Do we have a prefix sum of7400? The max is7800, but our sums go up to7800.

S[12] is7800, so no 7400. Doesn't work.

How about S[i]=2100 (S[2])

2100 +2600=4700: not present

S[i]=2700 (S[4]): 2700+2600=5300, nope.

S[i]=3500 (S[5]): 3500+2600=6100 (S[10]), which we already used.

Wait, another angle: Let's see if the prefix sums have differences of 2600.

From the list:

Check S[j] - S[i] =2600

Looking at S:

At index5:3500. Which is 900 (S[1]) +2600=2600+900=3500. So that's the pair we found.

Another possible?

Check S[8]=5200. 5200 - S[i] =2600 => S[i]=2600. Not present.

S[10]=6100: 6100- S[i]=2600 => S[i]=3500 (S[5]). Then next segment would be S[k]-S[10]=2600 => S[k]=8700. Which is beyond our prefix sums.

No good.

How about S[9]=5500: 5500 - S[i] =2600 => S[i]=2900, not present.

S[11]=7100: 7100- S[i]=2600 => S[i]=4500. Not present.

S[7]=4800: 4800 - S[i] =2600 => S[i]=2200 (S[3]). Then next segment would be 4800 +2600=7400, not in list.

So seems like only one solution here.

Therefore, the cuts are after stone1, stone5, and stone10.

Hence, cutting between gem #1 & #2, #5 & #6, #10 & #11.

The problem says "the final stone worthy of 700 loops back to the first stone worthy of 900", so stone numbering as per given order.

So the answer should be: cut after the first stone (between 900 and 1200), after the fifth stone (between 800 and 1100), and after the tenth stone (between 600 and 1000).

But to phrase it as where to cut.

Wait, the problem says: "where you gotta cut it". So probably list the positions.

In some similar puzzles, they say "cut between stone X and Y".

Given that in order:

The necklace has stones in the following sequence (with values):

1: 900

2: 1200

3: 100

4: 500

5: 800

6: 1100

7: 200

8: 400

9: 300

10: 600

11: 1000

12: 700

So cutting between:

- 1 and 2

- 5 and 6

- 10 and 11

Therefore, the three places to cut are after stone 1, after stone 5, and after stone 10.

But depending on whether "after" means at the end of the stone.

In typical terms for such problems, it's common to say "cut between gem number X and Y".

So the answer is: Cut between the first and second gem, fifth and sixth gem, and tenth and eleventh gem.

But let me check once more if there are other solutions.

Suppose someone starts at stone3.

S[3] =2200

Looking for S[j] =2200 +2600=4800 (S[7])

Then next would be 7400, which isn't present. So nope.

Start at stone4: S[4]=2700. Next would need 5300, not present.

How about if we consider wrap-around?

Suppose a segment wraps around the end.

For example, starting from stone12:

Stone12:700

Stone1:900

Sum so far:1600

Add stone2:1200 -> 2800

Still over.

Not likely.

Another way: Let's see if there is another triplet.

Suppose segment3 wraps around and has a different composition.

But according to our earlier calculation, the only solution seems to be the one found.

Therefore, confident that cutting after stone1, stone5, stone10 (i.e., between 1-2, 5-6, 10-11) works.

**Final Answer**
The necklace should be cut between the \boxed{1st} and \boxed{2nd}, \boxed{5th} and \boxed{6th}, and \boxed{10th} and \boxed{11th} gems.

# Answer

To determine where to cut the necklace so that breaking it into **three strands** results in each strand having an equal value, we begin by analyzing the total value of all gemstones on the necklace.

---

### 🧮 Step 1: Total Value Calculation

The values of the 12 stones (in order) are:

| Stone | Value |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | 900    |
| 2     | 1200   |
| 3     | 100    |
| 4     | 500    |
| 5     | 800    |
| 6     | 1100   |
| 7     | 200    |
| 8     | 400    |
| 9     | 300    |
| 10    | 600    |
| 11    | 1000   |
| 12    | 700    |

**Total value**:  
$$
900 + 1200 + 100 + 500 + 800 + 1100 + 200 + 400 + 300 + 600 + 1000 + 700 = \boxed{7800}
$$

So, each of the three strands must sum to:
$$
\frac{7800}{3} = \boxed{2600}
$$

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Identify Valid Segments Summing to 2600

We now look for **three non-overlapping segments** in the circular necklace that each sum to exactly **2600**.

Using a prefix sum approach (where $ S[n] $ is the cumulative sum of the first $ n $ stones), we find:

- $ S[1] = 900 $
- $ S[5] = 3500 $
- $ S[10] = 6100 $

Then:
- Segment from **stone 2 to stone 5** → Sum: $ S[5] - S[1] = 3500 - 900 = \boxed{2600} $
- Segment from **stone 6 to stone 10** → Sum: $ S[10] - S[5] = 6100 - 3500 = \boxed{2600} $
- Remaining segment (stone 11, stone 12, and stone 1) → Sum: $ 1000 + 700 + 900 = \boxed{2600} $

✅ All three segments sum to **2600**.

---

### 🔪 Step 3: Determine Where to Cut

To get these three segments, we need to make **three cuts** in the necklace:

- One **between stone 1 and 2**
- One **between stone 5 and 6**
- One **between stone 10 and 11**

These cuts divide the circular necklace into **three linear strands**, each with a value of **2600**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer

The necklace should be cut between:

$$
\boxed{1st} \text{ and } \boxed{2nd}, \quad
\boxed{5th} \text{ and } \boxed{6th}, \quad
\boxed{10th} \text{ and } \boxed{11th}
$$

This configuration ensures that each of the three resulting strands has a total value of **2600**, as required.
