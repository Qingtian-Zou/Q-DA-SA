# Thinking

We need to interpret: There is a necklace with stones in circular order: 900,1200,100,500,800,1100,200,400,300,600,1000,700 (12 stones). We want to break it at three places (i.e., choose 3 cut positions) so that the resulting three segments have equal total value. The necklace is circular; breaking at 3 places yields 3 strands. They want each segment's sum of stone values equal. We need to find cuts positions (indices) such that sums are equal.

We can think of splitting a circle into 3 arcs with equal sums. Equivalent to partitioning the sequence of 12 numbers into 3 contiguous blocks around circle, each summing to same value. Since total sum must be divisible by 3. Let's compute total sum: 900+1200=2100; +100=2200; +500=2700; +800=3500; +1100=4600; +200=4800; +400=5200; +300=5500; +600=6100; +1000=7100; +700=7800. Total = 7800. Divided by 3 gives 2600 each.

Thus need to find three contiguous segments that sum to 2600 each.

Because it's a circle, we can consider any starting point and find segments of sum 2600. Equivalent to finding two cut points such that the sums between them equal 2600.

We could brute force search mentally or logically.

List indices: Let's index 1-12 as above.

Numbers: 
1:900
2:1200
3:100
4:500
5:800
6:1100
7:200
8:400
9:300
10:600
11:1000
12:700

We want to find segments summing 2600.

Let's compute prefix sums around the circle for convenience. We'll consider linear representation of length 24 (duplicate sequence) to handle wrap-around. But we can also search manually.

Compute cumulative sum from index1:

i=1:900
2:2100
3:2200
4:2700
5:3500
6:4600
7:4800
8:5200
9:5500
10:6100
11:7100
12:7800

So cumulative sum at 12 = 7800.

Now we need to find contiguous segment sums equal 2600. So look for pairs of indices where difference of prefix sums equals 2600 (or 2600 mod 7800). Starting from each index, see if adding numbers until sum 2600 reached.

Let's examine starting at 1: start=900 at i=1. Add next stones until we hit 2600: 
- 1:900
- add 2:1200 =>2100
- add 3:100 =>2200
- add 4:500 =>2700 (exceeds). So no segment starting at 1 with sum exactly 2600. But maybe we could consider wrap-around; but if you start at 1, you need to go around to include some after 12? Let's check full sequence; but if we overshoot before reaching end, then no segment starting at 1 equals 2600. However maybe a different segment length: Suppose from index1 to index5? That's sum up to 3500 > 2600. So none.

Now start at 2: start value 1200
- add 3:100 =>1300
- add4:500 =>1800
- add5:800 =>2600 exactly! Good. So segment from index2 through index5 sums to 2600. That gives one segment (2,3,4,5). Indices: 2-5 inclusive.

So first cut might be between 1 and 2? Wait we need three segments; but if we choose cuts at positions that separate these segments. We found a segment 2-5 sum=2600. Next we need two other segments each summing to 2600 contiguous on circle, non-overlapping covering all stones.

After segment 2-5, remaining stones are indices: 6-12 plus maybe wrap-around? The sequence after 5 is 6,7,8,9,10,11,12 then back to 1. So we need two segments that cover indices 6-12 and 1.

Let's check from index6:

Start at 6: value1100
Add 7:200 =>1300
Add 8:400 =>1700
Add 9:300 =>2000
Add10:600 =>2600 exactly! So segment 6-10 sums to 2600. Good.

Now remaining indices are 11,12,1 (since we used 2-5 and 6-10). Let's check if sum of those equals 2600. Values: index11=1000; index12=700 =>1700; plus index1=900 =>2600. Yes! So the third segment is indices 11,12,1.

Thus the cuts would be between indices: after index5 and before index6 (i.e., cut between stone 800 (index5) and stone 1100(index6)), between index10 and index11 (cut between stone600(index10) and stone1000(index11)), and between index1 and index2? Wait the third segment uses indices 11,12,1. The cut between index1 and index2 is already used as one of the cuts? Let's check: We have segments:

Segment A: indices 2-5 (1200+100+500+800 =2600)
Segment B: indices 6-10 (1100+200+400+300+600=2600)
Segment C: indices 11,12,1 (1000+700+900=2600)

Thus cuts are between:

- After index5 and before index6 (between 800 and 1100)
- After index10 and before index11 (between 600 and 1000)
- After index1 and before index2? Actually segment C uses indices 11,12,1. That means the cut between 1 and 2 is part of this segmentation: segment C ends at index1, next segment A starts at index2. So yes one cut is between stone 900 (index1) and 1200(index2). The third cut also would be between index10 and index11? Wait we have two cuts: after 5-6 and after 10-11. But we need three cuts to separate into three strands; but a circle with 3 cuts yields 3 strands, yes. The cuts are:

Cut1: between stone at index1 (900) and index2 (1200). Actually that cut defines boundary between segment C and A.
Cut2: between index5 (800) and index6 (1100). Boundary between segment A and B.
Cut3: between index10 (600) and index11 (1000). Boundary between segment B and C.

Alternatively we could also present them in order around the necklace. Starting at some point, you can cut at positions after indices 1,5,10? Wait after index1 is before index2; after index5 is before index6; after index10 is before index11. Yes.

So answer: cuts should be between stones worth 900 &1200, 800&1100, and 600&1000 (or in order around circle). That yields three segments of equal total value 2600 each.

But the problem may ask for where to cut; maybe they want positions relative to first stone? We can state: cut after the stone worth 900, after the stone worth 800, and after the stone worth 600. Let's confirm that these cuts produce segments as above:

Segment1: starting after cut at 900 (so from 1200 through 800) - yes.
Segment2: starting after cut at 800 (so from 1100 through 600) - yes.
Segment3: starting after cut at 600 (so from 1000 through 900) - yes.

Thus the answer: cut between stones of values 900-1200, 800-1100, and 600-1000. Equivalent to break necklace in such a way that one segment is 1200+100+500+800 =2600; second segment 1100+200+400+300+600=2600; third segment 1000+700+900=2600.

But maybe there are other solutions? Let's check if any alternative cuts exist. There may be only one solution because of unique arrangement but let's confirm by exploring all possible segments that sum to 2600:

We found one set: 2-5,6-10,11-1. Are there others? We could also consider starting at different indices; but we can rotate the necklace: If we choose a different rotation, we might find other sets of cuts. For instance, if we shift everything by one position (cut after index12 maybe), would that produce a different set? But essentially it's same cut positions relative to sequence, just rotated. But if we want all possible distinct sets of three cuts on the circle that yield equal sums, we can compute.

We have 12 stones; each cut is between two adjacent stones. There are 12 possible cut positions (between index i and i+1). We need choose 3 such that segments defined by them sum to 2600 each.

Our found set uses cuts after indices 1,5,10. But if we rotate all indices by some offset, we might get a different triple of cut positions: e.g., cut after indices 2,6,11? Let's check: After 2,6,11 produce segments:

- Segment A: from index3 to 6? Wait we need to order them around circle. Suppose we cut after 2, after 6, after 11 (in that order). Then segments would be:
Segment1: indices 3-6: 100+500+800+1100 =2500? Let's compute: 100+500=600; +800=1400; +1100=2500. Not 2600. So not good.

But if we shift by one from our found set: cut after 2,7,12? That yields segments: 
Segment1: indices3-7: 100+500+800+1100+200 =3100 >2600. So no.

So the only solution is our found set (maybe rotated versions that are equivalent). But since necklace is circular, any rotation of this cut triple gives a valid solution but effectively same relative positions. For instance, if we rotate the entire sequence by k positions, cuts will be after indices 1+k,5+k,10+k modulo12.

But maybe there could be another arrangement: e.g., cut after index3? Let's search systematically to see if any other contiguous segments sum to 2600 aside from 2-5 and 6-10. We can compute all start positions for a segment of sum 2600:

We already found start=2 gives end=5. Start=3? Starting at 100: add 500 =>600; +800=>1400; +1100=>2500; +200=>2700 >2600. So no.

Start=4: 500+800=1300;+1100=2400;+200=2600 exactly! So start at index4 to 7 gives sum 2600. That segment is indices4-7: values 500,800,1100,200 =>2600. Then remaining indices would be 8-12 and 1-3? Let's check if we can partition rest into two segments of 2600 each. Remaining sequence after 7 includes indices 8-12 then 1-3 (since circular). We need to find contiguous segment from index8 or later that sums 2600.

Let's compute cumulative sum starting at 8:

Index8:400
9:300 =>700
10:600 =>1300
11:1000 =>2300
12:700 =>3000 >2600. So not exactly 2600 before reaching end; but we can wrap around to start of circle.

Continue from index1: after index12, the next is 900 -> sum=3900? Wait if we continue beyond 12 we would go back to 1; but we need contiguous segment that may cross the boundary. Let's compute starting at 8 and include up to 12 then 1 etc until sum equals 2600.

Start at 8:400
9:300 =>700
10:600 =>1300
11:1000 =>2300
12:700 =>3000 (exceeds). So we overshoot before reaching 2600; thus no segment starting at 8. Next start at 9:

Index9:300
10:600 =>900
11:1000 =>1900
12:700 =>2600 exactly! Starting at index9 to index12 yields sum=2600. That covers indices 9-12.

Now remaining indices after 9-12 are 1-3? Actually we used segments:
Segment A: 4-7 (500,800,1100,200)
Segment B: 9-12 (300,600,1000,700)
Remaining indices: 1-3 (900,1200,100). Let's check sum: 900+1200+100 =2200? Wait 900+1200=2100; +100=2200. Not 2600. So this doesn't work.

But maybe we can choose different segmentation: Instead of using segment 4-7, we could use other segment for the remaining two segments. Let's explore systematically all possible start positions for a segment sum 2600:

We found start=2 -> end=5
start=3 none
start=4 -> end=7 (500+800+1100+200)
start=5? Let's compute: starting at index5: value800
6:1100 =>1900
7:200 =>2100
8:400 =>2500
9:300 =>2800 >2600. So no.
Start=6? We found start 6 -> end 10 (1100+200+400+300+600).
start=7: value200
8:400=>600
9:300=>900
10:600=>1500
11:1000=>2500
12:700=>3200 >2600. So no.
Start=8? None as we saw.
Start=9: 300+600+1000+700 =2600 (indices 9-12)
start=10: 600+1000+700+900+1200+100?? Wait wrap around after 12 back to 1 etc. Let's compute start at index10: 600
11:1000 =>1600
12:700 =>2300
1:900 =>3200 >2600. So no.
Start=11: 1000
12:700 =>1700
1:900 =>2600 exactly! Indices 11-1? Wait indices wrap: starting at 11 includes 11,12,1 -> values 1000+700+900 =2600. That's a segment of length3. So start=11->end=1.

Start=12: 700
1:900 =>1600
2:1200 =>2800 >2600. No.

So there are five distinct segments that sum to 2600:
- Segment S1: indices 2-5 (length4)
- Segment S2: indices 4-7 (length4)
- Segment S3: indices 6-10 (length5)
- Segment S4: indices 9-12 (length4)
- Segment S5: indices 11-1 (indices 11,12,1) length3

But we need to choose 3 non-overlapping segments that together cover all 12 indices. That is a partition into three contiguous arcs.

We found one solution: S1(2-5),S3(6-10),S5(11-1). Let's see if there are other partitions using other segments:

Possibility: Use S2 (4-7) and then find two other segments covering remaining indices 8-12,1-3? Actually after segment 4-7 we used indices 4-7. Remaining indices are 8,9,10,11,12,1,2,3. We need to partition them into two contiguous arcs each sum=2600.

Let's check if there is a segment of sum2600 that starts at index8? Starting at 8 none as we saw. Start 9 gave 9-12 (S4). After S4 uses indices 9-12, remaining indices are 1-3,8? Wait we used 4-7 and 9-12; remaining are 1-3 and 8. But those cannot form a contiguous segment because they are not adjacent due to wrap-around: The order around circle is ... Let's list the indices in circular order:

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12

Segments:
S2 uses 4-7. After that we have 8 then 9-12 and 1-3. But if we cut after 7 (between 7 and 8), the next segment could start at 8. We need contiguous block from 8 until some point that sums to 2600. Let's try to find such block.

Start at index8: 400
9:300 =>700
10:600 =>1300
11:1000 =>2300
12:700 =>3000 >2600, so not possible.

But we could start at index1: 900+1200+100=2200; need more but next is 500 ->2700 >2600. So no.

What about starting at index2? We already have segment S1 uses indices 2-5. But we might use different combination: For instance, if we choose segments S4(9-12) and S5(11-1) they'd overlap (since S5 includes 11). Overlap not allowed. So the only valid partition seems to be our found set.

But let's double-check if any other combination exists using S2 or S4 etc. Let's attempt all combinations systematically:

We need 3 segments each of sum 2600, covering all indices once. Equivalent to selecting cut positions such that cumulative sums from starting point are multiples of 2600.

Let’s represent prefix sums as earlier: [900,2100,2200,2700,3500,4600,4800,5200,5500,6100,7100,7800].

We need indices i<j<k such that the sum from start index to j-1 equals 2600, etc. But because circle, we can consider starting at any position and looking for positions where prefix sums difference =2600 mod total.

One method: compute cumulative sum modulo 2600? Wait 2600 *3 =7800. So we need points where prefix sum ≡0,2600,5200 (mod 7800). Because if you start at index1 as base 0. Then cuts positions correspond to prefix sums that are multiples of 2600: i.e., values in [0,2600,5200,7800]. But we also consider offset due to starting position.

Let's compute prefix sums from index1 as earlier:

Prefix sum after each index:
i=1 ->900
2->2100
3->2200
4->2700
5->3500
6->4600
7->4800
8->5200
9->5500
10->6100
11->7100
12->7800

We need to find 3 positions (including start) such that prefix sums are 0,2600,5200 modulo 7800. Starting point at index1 corresponds to sum=900; not zero. But we can rotate: If we choose starting position s, then the prefix sums from that start will be offset by subtracting cumulative sum up to s-1.

Let's consider all possible rotations (starting positions). For each rotation, compute new cumulative sums and see if they hit 0,2600,5200.

Better approach: Use prefix sums modulo 2600? Because we want segments of sum 2600. If we take prefix sums mod 2600, then a segment from i to j has sum multiple of 2600 if prefix[j]-prefix[i-1] ≡ 0 (mod 2600). So for each pair with same mod value.

Let's compute prefix sums modulo 2600:

prefix sums (from index1):
i=0: prefix[0]=0
1:900 ->900
2:2100->2100
3:2200->2200
4:2700->2700-2600=100
5:3500->3500-2600=900
6:4600->4600-2600=2000? Wait 4600-2600=2000. But modulo 2600 gives 2000.
7:4800->4800-2600*1=2200? Actually 4800-2600=2200; <2600 so 2200
8:5200->5200-2600*2=0? 2600*2=5200 => remainder 0
9:5500->5500-2600*2=300? Wait 2600*2=5200, remainder 300
10:6100->6100-2600*2=900? Actually 2600*2=5200, remainder 900
11:7100->7100-2600*2=1400? Wait 2600*2=5200, remainder 1900? Let's compute precisely: 7100-2600*2=7100-5200=1900. Yes 1900.
12:7800->7800-2600*3=0

So modulo values sequence: 
index (prefix up to i):
0:0
1:900
2:2100
3:2200
4:100
5:900
6:2000
7:2200
8:0
9:300
10:900
11:1900
12:0

We want segments where difference of prefix mods = 0. That means two indices with same modulo.

List indices for each modulo value:

mod 0: indices {0,8,12}
mod 100: index4
mod 300: index9
mod 900: indices1,5,10
mod 1900: index11
mod 2000: index6
mod 2100: index2
mod 2200: indices3,7

Now each pair of equal mod gives a segment sum multiple of 2600. We need to find three segments covering all indices exactly once (disjoint arcs). Let's consider possible sets:

- Using mod0 indices {0,8,12}. These correspond to prefix sums at positions 0 (before first), 8 (after index8), and 12 (after last). Differences:
  - 0->8: sum from 1 to 8 equals 5200? Wait difference in prefix values is 5200? Actually prefix[8]-prefix[0] = 5200, which mod 2600 is 0. So segment from index1 to index8 has sum 5200 (which is two times 2600). That's not a single segment of 2600 but two segments. But we can break at intermediate point? Actually if you cut at indices that correspond to prefix mod 0 positions, each difference between successive mod0 positions yields a multiple of 2600. For example:
    - from index1 to index8 sum =5200 which equals 2*2600.
    - from index9 to index12 sum =? Wait we need differences in order: indices 8 to 12 sum=2600? Let's compute prefix[12]-prefix[8] =7800-5200=2600. So segment from 9 to 12 has sum 2600. That works.
    - But then we still have remaining indices 1-8 but that's 5200 which is not a single segment; but could be split into two segments each 2600: maybe cut at some other point within 1-8.

But the cuts must produce exactly three contiguous segments, not more. So we cannot just use mod0 positions alone.

- Use mod900 indices {1,5,10}. Differences:
   - 1->5 sum from index2 to 5 =? prefix[5]-prefix[1] =3500-900=2600. Good segment 2-5.
   - 5->10 sum from 6 to 10: prefix[10]-prefix[5] =6100-3500=2600. Good segment 6-10.
   - 10->? after that we need segment from 11 to something such that sum 2600; but next mod900 index is none beyond 12? Wait there's no other mod900 after 10 until wrap-around maybe index? But we can consider starting at 1 again: 10->?? Actually the sequence of indices in order around circle: 1,5,10. We have segments:
        Segment A: from 2 to 5 (as above).
        Segment B: from 6 to 10.
   After 10, we go to next index after 10 that is also mod900? None until wrap-around at index? But if we consider start at index1 again maybe we get segment from 11 to 1? Actually the difference between prefix[12] and prefix[10]? Let's compute sum from 11 to 12: 1000+700=1700. Not 2600. Then we need to include index1 as well: 1700 + 900 =2600. So segment from 11-12-1 is sum 2600. That matches mod900 difference? Wait prefix[12]-prefix[10] =7800-6100=1700. Not 2600. But the next mod900 after index10 in circular sense might be at index?? There is no further mod900 beyond 10 until we wrap around to 1 again (index1). Actually index1 is mod900 as well. So consider segment from index11 to index1: that's indices 11,12,1: sum 2600. Yes.

Thus the cuts are between indices at positions 1-2? Wait let's analyze: We have segments:
- Segment 1: indices 2-5
- Segment 2: indices 6-10
- Segment 3: indices 11-12-1

These correspond to cuts after index1, after index5, and after index10. So indeed we get the solution.

Now check if there are other combinations using mod0 or others that produce exactly three segments of sum 2600 each:

- Use mod0 positions {0,8,12}. That gives two segments: from 9 to 12 sum 2600 (positions 9-12). And remaining indices 1-8 sum 5200. But we need further partition into two segments each 2600. Maybe we can find a cut within 1-8 such that each part sums 2600. Let's check if there is segment of sum 2600 within the first eight indices: indices 1-8 values: [900,1200,100,500,800,1100,200,400]. We need to find contiguous subarray with sum 2600. Let's compute cumulative sums for that part:

index1=900
2:2100
3:2200
4:2700
5:3500
6:4600
7:4800
8:5200

We want difference of two prefix values to be 2600. Check pairs:
- 2100-? None equals 2600? 2100-? 900=1200, not.
- 2200-? -> 2200-? 900=1300; 2100=1100
- 2700-? -> 2700-? 900=1800; 2100=600; 2200=500
- 3500-? -> subtract earlier prefixes: 3500-900=2600! That is indices1 to5 sum 2600. So segment 1-5 sum 2600. Good.
- 4600-? 2000? Actually 4600-2000=2600 but we don't have prefix 2000 in first eight (prefix values: 900,2100,2200,2700,3500,4600). None is 2000. So no other.

Also maybe 4800-? =2600 -> 4800-2200=2600 gives segment indices3-7? Wait prefix at index7 is 4800; subtract prefix at index2 (2100) yields 2700 not 2600. Subtract at index3 (2200): 4800-2200=2600, that corresponds to segment indices4-7: values [500,800,1100,200] sum 2600. Yes.

Similarly, 5200-? =2600 -> subtract prefix at index8 minus something? Actually we need difference between two prefixes within first eight: maybe 5200-2600=2600. But prefix of 2600 is not present in first eight except after wrap-around from start? Wait prefix[??] none equals 2600. So no.

Thus there are segments inside first eight that sum to 2600: indices1-5 and indices4-7, etc. But we need exactly two such segments covering all eight indices with no overlap. Let's check if possible:

We have two candidate segments within indices1-8:
- Segment A: 1-5 (900+1200+100+500+800=3500? Wait that's 3500? Actually compute: 900+1200=2100; +100=2200; +500=2700; +800=3500. That sum is 3500, not 2600. Let's recalc: We found earlier prefix difference 3500-900 =2600: So indices 2-5 sum to 2600? Wait we need careful.

Let's re-evaluate: For first eight indices, we had prefix values at each index:
i=1 -> prefix[1]=900
i=2 ->2100
i=3 ->2200
i=4 ->2700
i=5 ->3500
i=6 ->4600
i=7 ->4800
i=8 ->5200

Now we look for pairs with difference 2600:
- prefix[5] - prefix[?] =2600. So prefix[5]=3500. We need prefix[?] =900 (prefix[1]). That gives indices 2-5 sum 2600 (1200+100+500+800). Yes segment from index2 to 5, not including index1.
- prefix[6]-prefix[?] =2600: prefix[6]=4600. Need prefix[?]=2000; none present.
- prefix[7]-prefix[?] =2600: prefix[7]=4800. Need prefix[?]=2200 (prefix[3]). That gives indices 4-7 sum 2600 (500+800+1100+200). Yes segment 4-7, not including index1.
- prefix[8]-prefix[?] =2600: prefix[8]=5200. Need prefix[?]=2600; none present.

Thus only two segments inside first eight indices sum to 2600: 
Segment A: indices 2-5
Segment B: indices 4-7

But these overlap (indices 4-5 overlapped). So cannot use them together. Another possibility: we could have segment of length >? Wait maybe there is also a segment from index6 to something that sums 2600 within first eight? But prefix[6]-prefix[?] difference not 2600 as seen.

Thus inside first eight indices, only possible segments sum 2600 are those overlapping. So cannot partition the set of indices 1-8 into two disjoint contiguous segments each summing 2600. Thus using mod0 positions to split at index8 and then further dividing 1-8 into two equal-sum segments is impossible.

Thus our earlier found solution seems unique (mod900 indices). Let's check if we can also use segment S2 or S4 or others with other combinations to produce a partition.

We have five segments sum=2600. We need to pick three that together cover all 12 indices disjointly and each contiguous. This is like covering the circle with arcs equal to these segments. Since the total length of the necklace is 12, we can try combinations of lengths:

Segment lengths:
- S1: length4 (indices2-5)
- S2: length4 (indices4-7)
- S3: length5 (indices6-10)
- S4: length4 (indices9-12)
- S5: length3 (indices11-1)

We need three segments covering 12 indices. Let's denote lengths L1+L2+L3 =12.

Possible triples of these lengths:

- 4,4,4 -> sum 12; possible if we can choose three disjoint segments each length4 that cover all indices. But our segments S1,S2,S4 are length4 each. Are they disjoint and cover all indices? Let's check: S1=2-5; S2=4-7 overlaps with S1 on indices 4,5. So cannot use both. S4=9-12 doesn't overlap with others but we need a third segment of length4 that covers the remaining indices after using two segments. Suppose we choose S1 and S4: they cover indices {2,3,4,5} and {9,10,11,12}. Remaining indices are 1,6,7,8? Wait we used 2-5 and 9-12; left indices 1,6,7,8. Those indices form a contiguous segment of length4 (1,6,7,8) but they are not contiguous around circle: after index5 comes 6, then 7, then 8, then 9. So indices 6-8 plus 1? Actually the remaining set is {1,6,7,8}. In circular order, starting at 1 ->2... we have 1 (index1) then 2 used; so the remaining after index5 to 8? Let's list entire circle: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. After using segments 2-5 and 9-12, we have left indices: 1,6,7,8. They are not contiguous because there's a gap between 5 and 6? Wait but 6 is adjacent to 5; yes after index5 comes 6 which is unused; then 7 and 8; then 9 used. So the remaining indices from 6-8 are contiguous: 6,7,8. But we also have index1, which is not adjacent to 8 because after 12 comes 1. Actually after index8 goes to 9 (used), so index1 is separated by used segments? Let's examine adjacency:

Indices adjacency: 1<->2; 2<->3; 3<->4; 4<->5; 5<->6; 6<->7; 7<->8; 8<->9; 9<->10; 10<->11; 11<->12; 12<->1.

Used segments: 2-5 covers indices 2,3,4,5. So those are removed.
Segment 9-12 covers indices 9,10,11,12. So removed.

Remaining: 1,6,7,8.

But are these remaining contiguous as a single segment? Let's check adjacency:

Between index1 and index6: they are not adjacent; the path from 1 to 6 goes through used indices: 1->2 (used) ->3(used)->4(used)->5(used)->6. So cannot form contiguous segment.

But we could have two segments of lengths 4 and 8? Wait we need exactly three segments, not more. But if we choose segments S1(4) and S4(4), the remaining indices (1,6,7,8) are length 4 but not contiguous: they consist of index1 at one end and indices 6-8 adjacent to each other; but there is a break between index5 used and index6. However we can reorder segments such that the three cuts produce arcs covering all indices contiguously: We must choose cut positions such that arcs are consecutive around circle.

We can consider cuts at positions after certain indices. For example, if we cut after index1 (between 1-2), after index5 (between 5-6), and after index8? Wait we need to produce arcs: Starting from cut after index1, next cut after index5 gives arc from 2 to5 length4; next cut after index8 gives arc from 6 to8 length3; last arc from 9 to1 length4. That would give segments lengths 4,3,4 =11 not 12. But we need all indices covered.

Thus the earlier found partition S1,S3,S5 seems only solution.

But let's verify if any other combination of three disjoint segments sum=2600 each exists.

Let's systematically enumerate all possible sets of cuts (three cut positions) that produce contiguous arcs with equal sums. Because there are 12 positions; choose 3 out of 12 to cut, resulting in 3 arcs. We can search logically: Suppose we start at index1 and decide where to make first cut. Let's do exhaustive enumeration manually.

Approach: For each possible first cut after some index i (i from 1..12), compute sum of segment starting at next index j until we reach 2600; that determines second cut position. Then check if remaining arc sums 2600 as well.

Because the necklace is circular, we can assume we start at index1 for convenience: choose first cut after some index k (so first arc goes from index(k+1) to ...?). Wait we need to define arcs properly.

Let's label cuts positions between indices. Suppose we choose cut positions C1, C2, C3 in order around circle. Starting from C1, the first segment includes stones between C1 and C2 (exclusive of C1? Actually if cut at position after index a, then that cut is between stone a and a+1. So segment starting after cut C1 ends just before next cut C2. But we can think of arcs as contiguous subsequences.

We need to find triple of indices (cut positions) such that each arc sum 2600.

Because the necklace has only 12 stones, there are finite possibilities. We could brute force by listing all 3-element subsets of 12 and checking sums, but let's reason systematically.

Alternatively, we can look at prefix sums modulo 2600 again: The condition for equal partition is that the cumulative sum from starting point to each cut must be multiples of 2600. Starting at some index s as start of first arc; then after some length L1 (where sum=2600), cut occurs; then next segment also length L2 with sum=2600; third automatically sum 2600.

Thus we need a sequence of three partial sums equal to k*2600 where k=1,2,3. Equivalent to find two positions along the cumulative sum array (starting at s) where prefix differences are 2600 and 5200 mod total. This is equivalent to picking indices i<j such that prefix[i]-prefix[s-1] =2600 and prefix[j]-prefix[s-1]=5200 (mod 7800). So essentially we need two positions where cumulative sums relative to start equal 2600 and 5200.

Thus for each starting index s, we can compute the prefix sum from s. Because it's circular, we can treat it as extended array of length 24: indices 1..12 repeated. Then we need to find indices a,b in [s, s+11] such that cumulative sums difference is exactly 2600 and 5200.

But easier: We can compute all cumulative sums mod 2600? Wait if we consider prefix sum array P[0]=0; P[i]=sum of first i stones (1-indexed). Then the sum from index a to b inclusive = P[b]-P[a-1] (mod total). For our problem, we need arcs of equal sum S=2600. So for some starting index s, we need positions t1,t2 such that sum(s..t1)=S and sum(t1+1..t2)=S; then rest automatically S.

Alternatively, we can find two positions in prefix sums such that differences are multiples of S. Because total =3*S. So if we choose start at s-1 (prefix index before starting stone), then the prefixes P[t]-P[s-1] should equal S and 2S for t being cut positions.

Thus we need to find indices i<j in [s, s+12] such that P[j]-P[i] = 2600 and P[k]-P[i] = 5200? Actually we might not need j because we can just find two positions after start where prefix sum relative to start equals 2600 and 5200.

Thus we can treat the array of stone values as a circular sequence; we want to find indices where cumulative sums equal 2600, 5200, 7800 relative to some starting index. Equivalent to find indices in extended prefix sums that differ by multiples of 2600.

But because we found one solution with start at index2? Wait the partition we found uses segments:
Segment A: 2-5 sum=2600
Segment B:6-10 sum=2600
Segment C:11-12-1 sum=2600

We can think of starting at index2 (just after cut between 1 and 2). Then segment from index2 to 5 sum=2600. Next segment from 6 to 10 sum=2600. Next segment from 11 to 1 sum=2600.

Thus cuts are: after index1, after index5, after index10. Starting at index2 works. But we can also start at other positions maybe leading to same cuts but rotated.

Let's test if any other starting position yields a valid partition with different cuts.

Consider starting at index3 (just after cut between 2 and 3). Then we need segment of sum2600 from index3 onward. Let's compute cumulative sums from index3:

Indices values from 3: 100,500,800,1100,200,400,300,600,1000,700,900,1200? Wait after index12 wrap to index1 (900), then 2 (1200). Actually we need up to 12 indices.

Let's compute sum from index3:
- 3:100
- 4:500 =>600
- 5:800 =>1400
- 6:1100 =>2500
- 7:200 =>2700 -> >2600. So no segment of length starting at 3 that sums to exactly 2600.

Thus starting at index3 fails.

Starting at index4: we computed earlier sum from 4:500+800=1300; +1100=2400; +200=2600 exactly! So segment from 4-7 sum=2600. Then next segment from 8 onward: indices 8,9,... to find next 2600.

From index8:
- 8:400
- 9:300 =>700
- 10:600 =>1300
- 11:1000 =>2300
- 12:700 =>3000 >2600. So no segment from 8 that sums exactly to 2600 before reaching end of circle? But we can wrap-around: after index12, next is index1 (900) etc. Let's continue:
After 12 -> 1:900 =>3900
2:1200 =>5100
3:100 =>5200
4:500 =>5700? Wait we might overshoot again.

But we only need to find a segment from index8 such that sum=2600. Let's compute cumulative sums starting at index8:

Start at 8:400
9:300 =>700
10:600 =>1300
11:1000 =>2300
12:700 =>3000 >2600

So the partial sums up to index12 exceed 2600. So there is no contiguous subsegment starting at 8 that sums exactly 2600 before wrapping. But maybe if we wrap around, we could get a segment from 8 through some of indices after 12 back to some earlier indices. Let's compute further:

Continue from index1: +900 =>3900
2:+1200=>5100
3:+100=>5200
4:+500=>5700

Now we see that cumulative sums go above 2600 at some point; but we might have a segment starting at 8 that wraps around and ends before exceeding 2600? Wait the sum from index8 to 12 is 3000 >2600. So any segment starting at 8 that includes indices 8-12 will already exceed 2600, so cannot produce exactly 2600 if it starts at 8. But maybe a segment that starts at 8 and wraps around to some earlier indices after finishing all others? Wait the sum from index8 to 7 (full circle) would be total 7800; but we want exactly 2600. So no.

Thus starting at index4 fails.

Starting at index5: Starting at 5: value800
6:1100 =>1900
7:200 =>2100
8:400 =>2500
9:300 =>2800 >2600. No segment of sum 2600 starting at 5.

Starting at index6: Starting at 6:1100+200=1300+400=1700+300=2000+600=2600 exactly! So segment from 6-10 sum=2600. Good. Next segment from 11 onward: indices 11,12,1,2? Wait we need to find a segment of sum 2600 starting at 11.

From index11:
- 11:1000
- 12:700 =>1700
- 1:900 =>2600 exactly! So segment 11-12-1 sum=2600. Then remaining indices 2-5? Wait we already used 6-10 and 11-12-1; leftover are indices 2,3,4,5 which sum to 1200+100+500+800 =2600 indeed. That matches our earlier partition but with different starting point: start at index6 gave first segment 6-10, second segment 11-12-1, third 2-5. But the cuts are same as before (after indices 5,10,1). So this is same set of cuts just rotated.

Starting at index7: Starting at 7:200+400=600+300=900+600=1500+1000=2500+700=3200 >2600. No segment.

Starting at index8: Starting at 8:400+300=700+600=1300+1000=2300+700=3000 >2600. No segment.

Starting at index9: Starting at 9:300+600=900+1000=1900+700=2600 exactly! So segment from 9-12 sum=2600. Next segment from 1 onward: indices 1,2,3,...? We need next segment of sum2600 starting at 1.

From index1:
- 1:900
- 2:1200 =>2100
- 3:100 =>2200
- 4:500 =>2700 >2600. So no segment from 1.

But maybe we could start second segment at 5? Wait after first cut at 12 (after index12), the next segment starts at index1; but we need sum=2600 starting at 1. It doesn't happen before exceeding 2600, so this partition fails.

Starting at index10: Starting at 10:600+1000=1600+700=2300+900=3200 >2600. No segment.

Starting at index11: Starting at 11:1000+700=1700+900=2600 exactly! So segment from 11-12-1 sum=2600. Next segment from 2 onward: we need segment of sum2600 starting at 2.

From index2:
- 2:1200
- 3:100 =>1300
- 4:500 =>1800
- 5:800 =>2600 exactly! So segment 2-5 sum=2600. Remaining indices 6-10? That sums to 1100+200+400+300+600 =2600. Yes this is same partition again.

Thus we see that the only valid cuts are between stones with values:

- cut1: after 900 (between stone1 and stone2)
- cut2: after 800 (between stone5 and stone6)
- cut3: after 600 (between stone10 and stone11)

These produce segments:
Segment A: 1200+100+500+800 =2600
Segment B: 1100+200+400+300+600=2600
Segment C: 1000+700+900=2600

So the answer is that you cut between stones worth 900-1200, 800-1100, and 600-1000.

But maybe there might be alternative cuts if we rotate the necklace? But in terms of absolute values, those are the only three pairs of adjacent stones to cut. However, because it's a circle, one could also choose to cut after stone2 (1200) etc? Wait let's double-check: We found that cut positions must be after index1, after index5, and after index10. But due to symmetry of circle, we might consider other rotations that produce same sets but starting at different points: e.g., if we rotate the necklace so that stone 900 is somewhere else; but relative adjacency remains same: there are exactly three pairs of adjacent stones whose values are [900-1200], [800-1100], [600-1000] (i.e., between those stones). But could we also cut after index2,5,10? Wait let's check if cutting after 2 yields equal sums? Suppose cuts at positions after index2, after index6, after index11? Let's test: Cut after 2 means one segment from 3-? to next cut. But our earlier enumeration indicated only the cuts after indices 1,5,10 produce equal segments.

But let's confirm by computing all possible triples of cuts that yield sums 2600 each:

We can brute force conceptually: There are C(12,3)=220 ways to choose 3 cut positions (unordered). However, since the necklace is cyclic, we need to consider order of cuts. But we can check all possibilities manually by reasoning.

Better approach: Let's enumerate all possible contiguous segments of length 1-11 that sum to 2600; these are the potential arcs. Then find triples of such arcs that cover the circle without overlap and with each arc contiguous.

We have found 5 candidate arcs (segments) sum=2600:

S1: indices2-5
S2: indices4-7
S3: indices6-10
S4: indices9-12
S5: indices11-1

But we might also consider arcs that start at index12 and end somewhere? For example, S6: maybe indices 12-? But let's check all possible segments of sum2600 by scanning the circle. We have found segments starting at each index that sum to 2600; there may be more than one per starting index? Let's double-check systematically:

Compute cumulative sums from each start:

Start at 1:
- 1:900
- 2:2100
- 3:2200
- 4:2700 >2600. So no segment starting at 1.

Start at 2:
- 2:1200
- 3:1300
- 4:1800
- 5:2600 exactly -> segment 2-5 (S1)
- continue maybe longer? 6:3700 >2600. So only S1.

Start at 3:
- 3:100
- 4:600
- 5:1400
- 6:2500
- 7:2700>2600 -> none.

Start at 4:
- 4:500
- 5:1300
- 6:2400
- 7:2600 exactly -> segment 4-7 (S2)
- continue to 8:3000 >2600

Start at 5:
- 5:800
- 6:1900
- 7:2100
- 8:2500
- 9:2800>2600 => none.

Start at 6:
- 6:1100
- 7:1300
- 8:1700
- 9:2000
-10:2600 exactly -> segment 6-10 (S3)
- continue to 11:3600 >2600

Start at 7:
- 7:200
- 8:600
- 9:900
-10:1500
-11:2500
-12:3200>2600 => none.

Start at 8:
- 8:400
- 9:700
-10:1300
-11:2300
-12:3000 >2600 -> none

Start at 9:
- 9:300
-10:900
-11:1900
-12:2600 exactly -> segment 9-12 (S4)
- continue to 1:3500>2600 => no more.

Start at 10:
- 10:600
-11:1600
-12:2300
-1:3200>2600 -> none

Start at 11:
- 11:1000
-12:1700
-1:2600 exactly -> segment 11-12-1 (S5)
- continue to 2:3800 >2600

Start at 12:
- 12:700
-1:1600
-2:2800>2600 => none.

Thus indeed only these five segments sum to 2600. So the only possible partitions must use three of these segments that are disjoint and cover all indices. Let's examine combinations:

We need a set of three arcs from {S1,S2,S3,S4,S5} such that they are pairwise non-overlapping (no index appears in more than one segment) and their union covers all 12 indices.

Let's list indices for each S:

- S1: 2,3,4,5
- S2: 4,5,6,7
- S3: 6,7,8,9,10
- S4: 9,10,11,12
- S5: 11,12,1

Now we need to pick three of these that together cover all indices {1..12} with no overlap. Let's see possibilities:

We could choose S3 (6-10) because it's long and covers a large block; the remaining indices are 1,2,3,4,5,11,12? Wait if we take S3: covers indices 6-10. Remaining indices: 1,2,3,4,5,11,12.

We need two segments covering these 7 indices disjointly. Options:

- Could use S1 (2-5) plus S5 (11,12,1). This covers indices {2,3,4,5} and {11,12,1}. Combined with S3 they cover all indices: {6-10}, {2-5}, {11,12,1}. These sets are disjoint: S3 covers 6-10; S1 covers 2-5; S5 covers 11-12-1. They cover all 12 indices. So one partition is S1,S3,S5. That matches our earlier solution.

Any other combination with S3? Let's test:

- Could use S4 (9-12) but S4 overlaps with S3 on indices 9,10; not allowed.
- Could use S2 (4-7) but overlaps with S3 on 6-7.
- Could use S1 and S4? They overlap? S1: 2-5; S4: 9-12; they don't overlap. But we still need a third segment to cover remaining indices: after using S1,S4, the uncovered indices are 6-10,1,2?? Wait check: Covered by S1 (2-5) and S4 (9-12). Uncovered: 1,6,7,8,9? Actually 9-12 covered; so left {1,6,7,8}. That set of four indices could be S3? Let's see S3 covers 6-10; includes 9,10 which are already covered. So no.

Could we use S2 and S5 maybe? Let's examine: S2 (4-7) plus S5 (11,12,1). They cover indices {4,5,6,7} and {11,12,1}. Remaining uncovered: 2,3,8,9,10. That is a block of length 5 but not contiguous? Actually 2-3 then skip to 8-10; that's two separate blocks. So cannot.

Could we use S4 and S1? We considered earlier. They cover 2-5 and 9-12 leaving indices {1,6,7,8,9,10}? Wait 9-12 covers 9-12, so left: 1,6,7,8? Actually we need to double-check.

Better approach: Let's enumerate all possible triples of segments that are disjoint and cover all indices. Since we have only five segments, we can list all combinations of three from them (C(5,3)=10) and check if they are pairwise disjoint and union covers all 12 indices.

Segments:

S1: {2,3,4,5}
S2: {4,5,6,7}
S3: {6,7,8,9,10}
S4: {9,10,11,12}
S5: {11,12,1}

Now let's test each triple:

Triple 1: S1,S2,S3. Overlap: S1∩S2 = {4,5} not allowed; so invalid.

Triple 2: S1,S2,S4. Overlaps: S1∩S2 = {4,5}. So invalid.

Triple 3: S1,S2,S5. Overlaps: S1∩S2 = {4,5}; also S2∩S5? S2 has {4-7} vs S5 {11,12,1}, no overlap. But S1∩S5? {2,3,4,5} vs {11,12,1} none. However the union would be indices {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,11,12}. Missing 8,9,10. So not covering all.

Triple 4: S1,S3,S4. Overlaps: S1∩S3 = empty? Wait S1 {2-5} vs S3 {6-10}: no overlap. S3∩S4 = {9,10}. Overlap present. So invalid.

Triple 5: S1,S3,S5. Overlaps: none; union covers all indices? Let's check: S1 {2,3,4,5}, S3 {6,7,8,9,10}, S5 {11,12,1}. Combined they cover 1-12 all exactly once. So valid.

Triple 6: S1,S4,S5. Overlaps: S1∩S4 empty; S4∩S5 = {11,12}? Wait S4 {9,10,11,12}, S5 {11,12,1} overlap at {11,12}. So invalid.

Triple 7: S2,S3,S4. Overlaps: S2∩S3 includes {6,7}; S3∩S4 includes {9,10}. So invalid.

Triple 8: S2,S3,S5. Overlaps: S2∩S3 = {6,7} -> invalid.

Triple 9: S2,S4,S5. Overlaps: S4∩S5 = {11,12}. So invalid.

Triple 10: S3,S4,S5. Overlaps: S3∩S4 includes {9,10}; S4∩S5 includes {11,12}. Invalid.

Thus the only valid triple is S1,S3,S5. So indeed there is a unique partition up to rotation (since we used absolute indices). But due to circle symmetry, any rotation of that partition will produce same relative adjacency pairs but with different index labels. However in terms of stone values, there might be multiple sets of cuts? Let's examine the actual positions: S1 corresponds to cut after index1 and before 2? Wait segment S1 covers indices 2-5; so it starts at index2 (after cut between 1-2) and ends at index5 (cut between 5-6). So cut positions are after index1, after index5. S3 covers indices 6-10: starts after index5, ends after index10. So cut after index10. Then S5 covers indices 11-12-1: start after index10? Wait segment S5 goes from 11 to 1 inclusive; but this is a bit weird because it wraps around across the end of sequence. But the cuts for S5 are between index10 and 11 (start) and between index1 and 2 (end). Actually segment S5 starts at index11 after cut between 10-11, ends at index1 before cut between 1-2.

Thus the three cuts are:
- Cut A: between indices 1 & 2
- Cut B: between indices 5 & 6
- Cut C: between indices 10 & 11

Alternatively, you could list them as positions after stone values 900, 800, and 600 respectively. But also note that if we rotate the necklace such that the starting point changes, we might end up cutting at other pairs of adjacent stones but the set of cuts relative to each other remains same: essentially we cut between three specific pairs: (value1,value2) where values are (900-1200), (800-1100), and (600-1000). However due to symmetry, you could also cut between (1200-100) maybe? But no.

Let's confirm that the cuts we identified produce equal sums. We already did.

Now we need to answer: "Where do you have to cut it?" The answer likely: Cut after the 900-value stone and before the 1200-value stone, after the 800-value stone before the 1100-value stone, and after the 600-value stone before the 1000-value stone. That yields three strands each worth 2600.

But maybe they want "cut between 1200 and 100, between 800 and 1100, and between 600 and 1000"? Let's double-check the segmentation we found: We had segments:
- Segment1: indices2-5 = [1200,100,500,800] sum=2600
- Segment2: indices6-10 = [1100,200,400,300,600] sum=2600
- Segment3: indices11-12-1 = [1000,700,900] sum=2600

Thus the cuts are between:
- 900 and 1200 (between indices1 &2)
- 800 and 1100 (between indices5 &6)
- 600 and 1000 (between indices10 &11)

Yes.

Alternatively, if we cut after index2? Wait the segment starting at 2 goes to 5. So the cut before 2 is between 1 and 2; the cut after 5 is between 5 and 6. But maybe you could also start at different stone for segment 1: For instance, segment 1 could be indices3-6? Let's check if that sums 2600? Wait 100+500+800+1100=2600? That sum is 100+500=600; +800=1400; +1100=2500 -> not. So no.

Thus only segmentation we found works.

Hence answer: cut after stone worth 900, after stone worth 800, and after stone worth 600. Alternatively, break between stones valued 900-1200, 800-1100, and 600-1000. This yields three equal-sum strands each worth 2600.

But we might also express that the cuts should be made after 900, 800, and 600 in the given order. Or "between the stones of value 900 & 1200, between 800 & 1100, and between 600 & 1000." Provide explanation maybe with sums: each segment will contain values summing to 2600.

We might also mention that this is unique solution (up to rotation). But we should confirm uniqueness. We already did enumeration of all possible arcs; only one partition works. So answer unique.

But let's double-check if there could be another partition using the same cuts but in different order? For instance, cut after index1, 5, and 10 produce segments as described. If we choose to cut after indices 2,6,11 maybe that also yields equal sums? Let's test: Cuts after 2,6,11 produce arcs:

Segment1: indices3-5? Wait if cuts after 2 then segment from index3 to 6? Actually let's define: cut after 2 means one boundary between stone 1200 and 100. So first arc will start at index3 (value 100). Next cut after 6 is between 1100 and 200. That would end segment1 at index5? Wait the arc from after cut 2 to before cut 6 includes indices 3,4,5? Actually let's list indices around circle:

Indices: 1(900),2(1200),3(100),4(500),5(800),6(1100),7(200),8(400),9(300),10(600),11(1000),12(700)

If cuts after 2,6,11:
- Cut after 2: boundary between 1200 and 100
- Cut after 6: boundary between 1100 and 200
- Cut after 11: boundary between 1000 and 700

Now arcs are:
Arc1: from index3 to index5? Wait arc from cut after 2 (between 2&3) to next cut after 6 (between 6&7). So includes indices 3,4,5,6? Actually the segment includes stone 6 as well because cut is after 6. So indices 3-6 inclusive: values [100,500,800,1100] sum = 100+500=600; +800=1400; +1100=2500. Not 2600.

Thus that partition fails. So indeed only our earlier cuts work.

Therefore answer is unique up to rotation of the necklace (which doesn't change which stones you cut between). But maybe the problem expects you to mention that you need to cut after 900, after 800, and after 600. Provide reasoning: each segment sum 2600.

We can also present a general method: The total value is 7800, so each strand must be worth 2600. Find positions where cumulative sums equal multiples of 2600. Starting from 1, we compute cumulative sums; find indices where the partial sum equals 2600 (indices2-5) and 5200 (indices6-10). The remaining segment is 11-12-1. So cuts at after index1,5,10.

But let's double-check: Did we misinterpret "break the necklace in three places" meaning cut into three strands? Yes. So each cut yields a strand. That means we need to find three positions where we cut such that each resulting piece (strand) has equal total value. So answer as above.

Let's also consider if there might be multiple solutions due to symmetrical arrangement of values; but we enumerated all possible segments sum 2600 and found only one valid partition. So unique solution.

But the problem may want a description like: "Cut between the 900-1200 stones, the 800-1100 stones, and the 600-1000 stones." This yields three strands with values 1200+100+500+800=2600; 1100+200+400+300+600=2600; 1000+700+900=2600.

Let's verify each sum: 
Segment1: 1200 + 100 =1300, plus 500 =1800, plus 800 =2600.
Segment2: 1100+200=1300, +400=1700, +300=2000, +600=2600.
Segment3: 1000+700=1700, +900=2600.

All good. So answer is as above.

But maybe the problem expects you to find that cutting between stones with values (1200-100) etc? Wait we need to double-check our cuts relative to segment boundaries. Our partition segments:

Segment1: indices 2-5 inclusive: [1200,100,500,800]
Segment2: indices6-10 inclusive: [1100,200,400,300,600]
Segment3: indices11-12-1 inclusive: [1000,700,900]

Thus the cuts are between:
- Between index1 (value 900) and index2 (1200). That is cut after stone value 900.
- Between index5 (800) and index6 (1100).
- Between index10 (600) and index11 (1000).

Yes.

But maybe we could also think of cutting between 900-1200, 800-1100, 600-1000. But also if you rotate the necklace, you'd cut after 1200-100? Wait that might produce different set but still equal sums? Let's test: Suppose we choose cuts after index2 (between 1200 and 100), after index6 (between 1100 and 200), after index11 (between 1000 and 700). This would give segments:
Segment1: indices3-5? Actually segment from after 2 to before 6 includes indices3,4,5,6? Wait cut after 2 then cut after 6 means segment includes indices 3,4,5,6. Sum = 100+500+800+1100=2500 not 2600.

So that fails.

Thus unique solution as found.

We should also check if the problem statement might allow us to cut at any of the three points (the order doesn't matter). So answer: "Between stones worth 900 and 1200, between 800 and 1100, and between 600 and 1000." Provide explanation that each strand sums to 2600.

Alternatively, we can express cuts after 1st stone value 900, after 5th stone value 800, after 10th stone value 600. But careful: We cut at three places, so we might think of the first cut as before stone2 (between 1-2), second cut between 5-6, third cut between 10-11.

Better to express relative positions: The necklace should be cut just after the 900-value gem and before the 1200-value gem; also after the 800-value gem and before the 1100-value gem; and after the 600-value gem and before the 1000-value gem. That yields three equal-sum strands.

We can also present as "Cut between 900-1200, between 800-1100, between 600-1000." Provide sums: each strand totals 2600.

Now let's produce a final answer:

Total value = 7800. Each strand must be worth 2600. Compute cumulative sums; find positions where partial sum equals 2600 and 5200. That yields indices after 1 (900), after 5 (800), after 10 (600). The resulting strands are:
- 1200+100+500+800 = 2600
- 1100+200+400+300+600 = 2600
- 1000+700+900 = 2600

Thus you cut at the three places described.

But maybe the problem expects a diagram or reasoning? We'll provide explanation: The only way to partition into equal sums is as above. So answer: Cut between stones valued 900 and 1200, between 800 and 1100, and between 600 and 1000.

We might also mention that this yields three strands with values of 2600 each; it's unique up to rotation. Provide a small explanation of why no other cuts work.

Thus final answer: cut after the 900-value stone (between 900 and 1200), after the 800-value stone (between 800 and 1100), and after the 600-value stone (between 600 and 1000). That gives three equal-sum strands of 2600. And we might also state that any rotation yields same relative cuts.

Double-check: The third segment uses indices 11-12-1: values 1000,700,900. Yes sum 2600.

Let's also verify if the segmentation could be rotated such that first cut is after index2? But that would produce segments [3-6], [7-10], [11-1]? Let's test: If we rotate by shifting starting point to index2, we might get cuts at positions after indices 2 (between 1200 and 100), after index6 (between 1100 and 200), after index11 (between 1000 and 700). But that fails as earlier. So only unique solution.

Thus answer is ready.

However, the problem may ask: "Where do you have to cut it?" The answer: "Between the stones with values 900-1200, 800-1100, and 600-1000." Provide explanation or sums.

We can also mention that the segments will be:
- From 1200 to 800 inclusive (four stones)
- From 1100 to 600 inclusive (five stones)
- From 1000 to 900 inclusive (three stones)

Now produce final answer with explanation.

But let's think if there's any alternative representation: maybe they want you to identify that the cuts should be made at positions after the first stone, after the fifth stone, and after the tenth stone. That yields segments of lengths 4,5,3 respectively.

We can phrase: "Cut after the 900-value gem (between 900 and 1200), after the 800-value gem (between 800 and 1100), and after the 600-value gem (between 600 and 1000). This yields three strands each worth 2600."

Alternatively, if they want to describe positions relative to starting point: cut at positions that separate indices 1-2, 5-6, and 10-11.

Now produce final answer. Also mention that the sums are equal to 2600. Provide demonstration.

Let's produce final answer accordingly.

But also we might consider the possibility of cutting at other positions if we choose a different starting point for counting stones. But since it's a necklace, any rotation yields same relative cuts; but the problem likely expects you to state the cuts in terms of stone values or indices as above.

Now let's write the solution:

1. Compute total value: 7800.
2. Each strand must sum to 2600.
3. Compute cumulative sums along the sequence until we reach 2600 and 5200, giving cut positions after index5 (between 800-1100) and after index10 (between 600-1000). The third cut is automatically between 900-1200 because remaining segment must also sum to 2600.

Thus answer: Cut after the stone worth 900, after the stone worth 800, and after the stone worth 600. Provide final sums verifying equal totals.

Also we could illustrate with diagram.

Ok let's produce final answer accordingly.

But perhaps they want you to identify that there is only one unique way (up to rotation) to cut it: between stones valued 900–1200, 800–1100 and 600–1000. Provide the sums of each strand as demonstration.

We can also add explanation: The total value is 7800, dividing by 3 gives 2600 per strand; we find segments that sum to 2600 using cumulative sums: 1200+100+500+800=2600 (cut after 900), etc. Provide final answer.

Let's craft final answer:

- Cut between the 900‑stone and the 1200‑stone,
- Cut between the 800‑stone and the 1100‑stone,
- Cut between the 600‑stone and the 1000‑stone.

This gives strands of:
- 1200+100+500+800 = 2600
- 1100+200+400+300+600 = 2600
- 1000+700+900 = 2600

Therefore these are the cuts needed. And it's unique up to rotation.

Also we might note that if you cut elsewhere, the sums won't be equal; thus this is the only solution.

Now produce final answer accordingly.

# Answer

The total value of all the stones is  

\[
900+1200+100+500+800+1100+200+400+300+600+1000+700 = 7800.
\]

Since we want three equal‑value strands, each strand must be worth  

\[
\frac{7800}{3}=2600 .
\]

So we look for contiguous blocks of stones whose values add up to 2600.

### Finding the cuts

Compute running sums around the necklace:

| index | stone value | running sum |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | 900 | 900 |
| 2 |1200|2100|
| 3 | 100 |2200|
| 4 | 500 |2700 (exceeds 2600) |

No block starting at 1 works.  
Starting at 2:

\[
1200+100+500+800 = 2600
\]

so a cut must be after the stone **900** (between stones 1–2) and before the stone **800** (after stone 5).

Continuing from the next stone (1100):

\[
1100+200+400+300+600 = 2600
\]

which gives another cut after stone 10 (between stones 10–11).

The remaining three stones automatically sum to

\[
1000+700+900 = 2600.
\]

Thus the third cut is between stone 600 and stone 1000.

---

### The three equal‑value strands

1. **1200 + 100 + 500 + 800** = 2600  
   (stones 2–5)

2. **1100 + 200 + 400 + 300 + 600** = 2600  
   (stones 6–10)

3. **1000 + 700 + 900** = 2600  
   (stones 11,12,1)

---

**Answer:** Cut the necklace at the three positions between

- the stone worth **900** and the one worth **1200**,  
- the stone worth **800** and the one worth **1100**,  
- the stone worth **600** and the one worth **1000**.

These cuts give three strands each worth 2600, which is the only possible way to split the necklace into equal‑value pieces.
