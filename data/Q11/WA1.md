# Thinking

We need to interpret: We have necklace with stones values in order given, circular sequence of 12 values: [900,1200,100,500,800,1100,200,400,300,600,1000,700] and loops back to start.

Need to break at three places such that the resulting three segments each sum equal. That is find indices i<j<k where cuts produce segments: from i to j-1, j to k-1, k to end-1 then wrap to i-1? Since necklace circular, we can choose any starting point.

Goal: find 3 cuts that partition into three contiguous pieces each with equal sum. Sum total S = compute.

Let's calculate quickly: 900+1200=2100; +100=2200; +500=2700; +800=3500; +1100=4600; +200=4800; +400=5200; +300=5500; +600=6100; +1000=7100; +700=7800. Total S=7800.

Divide by 3 => each segment sum = 2600.

We need to find contiguous segments of sums 2600 each.

Since necklace is circular, we can choose any start index and cut after accumulating 2600, then again after next 2600 etc.

Let's check sequence for partial sums: starting at index1=900. cumulative:

index1 (900) cum=900
index2 +1200 =>2100
index3 +100=>2200
index4 +500=>2700 >2600 so we need cut earlier? Let's consider different start points.

We need contiguous segment of sum 2600. So find subarray sums equal to 2600.

Let's list values with indices:

1:900
2:1200
3:100
4:500
5:800
6:1100
7:200
8:400
9:300
10:600
11:1000
12:700

We need contiguous sums of 2600. Let's try combinations.

Start at 1: sum to index2 =2100; add idx3 =>2200; add idx4=>2700 >2600. So no segment starting at 1 equal 2600.

Start at 2: 1200+100=1300, +500=1800, +800=2600 exactly. So indices 2-5 gives sum 2600. Good. That would be one segment from stone 2 to 5 inclusive.

Now need next segment starting after index5 (i.e., at index6) sum 2600.

Start at 6:1100+200=1300, +400=1700, +300=2000, +600=2600. So indices 6-10 give sum 2600. Good. Next segment starts at index11: need 2600 sum.

Index11:1000+700=1700; then wrap around to start of necklace? Wait we still have stones left from start 1 and maybe earlier ones. After cutting after index10, the remaining part consists of indices 11-12-1? But we already used indices 1 in first segment? Actually first segment was 2-5; second 6-10; third would be 11-12-1? Wait we cut at three places: between 5-6, 10-11, and something else. Let's check.

We have used indices 2-5 as segment A, 6-10 as B. Remaining stones are 11,12,1 (since circular). Sum of these: 1000+700+900=2600! Indeed equals 2600. So we can cut after index10 and before index11, then after index12 and before index1? Wait the third segment is 11-12-1 contiguous in circle: from stone 11 to 12 then wrap to 1.

Thus cuts positions: between 5 and 6, between 10 and 11, and between 12 and 1. That gives three equal-sum segments each 2600.

So answer: cut after stone valued 800 (index5) and after stone valued 600 (index10) and after stone valued 700 (index12). Equivalent to cuts at positions between stones: 800-1100, 600-1000? Wait check indices:

Index mapping:
1:900
2:1200
3:100
4:500
5:800
6:1100
7:200
8:400
9:300
10:600
11:1000
12:700

Cuts after index5 (between 800 and 1100)
after index10 (between 600 and 1000)
and after index12 (between 700 and back to 900).

Segments:
1) 1200,100,500,800 =2600
2) 1100,200,400,300,600=2600
3) 1000,700,900=2600

Yes.

# Answer

**Step‑by‑step**

The necklace has the following values in order (and then it wraps back to the first):

| # | Value |
|---|-------|
|1| 900|
|2| 1200|
|3| 100|
|4| 500|
|5| 800|
|6| 1100|
|7| 200|
|8| 400|
|9| 300|
|10| 600|
|11| 1000|
|12| 700|

1. **Total value**

\[
900+1200+100+500+800+1100+200+400+300+600+1000+700 = 7800
\]

2. **Value each piece must have**

Since we want three equal‑worth strands, each should sum to

\[
\frac{7800}{3}=2600.
\]

3. **Find contiguous segments of 2600**

Starting from stone #2:

- 1200 + 100 + 500 + 800 = 2600 (stones 2–5)

Next segment starts at stone #6:

- 1100 + 200 + 400 + 300 + 600 = 2600 (stones 6–10)

The remaining stones are 11,12,1 (because the necklace is circular):

- 1000 + 700 + 900 = 2600 (stones 11,12,1)

All three segments have equal value.

4. **Where to cut**

We need cuts between the following pairs of adjacent stones:

| Cut position | Between which stones |
|--------------|----------------------|
| 1 | after stone #5 (value 800) – before stone #6 (1100) |
| 2 | after stone #10 (value 600) – before stone #11 (1000) |
| 3 | after stone #12 (value 700) – before stone #1 (900) |

These three cuts give the strands:

- **Strand A:** 1200 → 100 → 500 → 800 = 2600  
- **Strand B:** 1100 → 200 → 400 → 300 → 600 = 2600  
- **Strand C:** 1000 → 700 → 900 = 2600  

Each strand is worth exactly the same amount. Thus, cut after the 800‑stone, after the 600‑stone, and after the 700‑stone to satisfy the condition.
