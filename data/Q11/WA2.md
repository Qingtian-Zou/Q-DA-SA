# Thinking

We need cut positions such that sums equal. Necklace circular list of 12 values. Find three contiguous segments with equal sum. Total sum =? compute: 900+1200=2100; +100=2200;+500=2700;+800=3500;+1100=4600;+200=4800;+400=5200;+300=5500;+600=6100;+1000=7100;+700=7800. Total 7800. Each segment sum =2600. Need find cuts indices where cumulative sums difference 2600. Compute prefix sums: index1=900;2=2100;3=2200;4=2700;5=3500;6=4600;7=4800;8=5200;9=5500;10=6100;11=7100;12=7800. Need start positions such that sum of next 12? find segment sums of length variable. Find first cut at index i where prefix[i-1] to prefix[i+len-1] equals 2600. Let's brute mentally: from start 1: need 2600 total after some number of stones. Prefix sums: after 4 stones=2700 too high; after3=2200 low; so not starting at1.

Start2 (value1200): cumulative from2:1200+100=1300; +500=1800;+800=2600 exactly after 5 stones? Wait 1200+100+500+800=2600 yes. So cut between stone4 and5? Actually start at stone2 ends at stone5? Sequence indices 2-5 inclusive sum2600. So first segment could be stones 2-5: values 1200,100,500,800.

Next segment should also 2600 starting after that, i.e., from stone6 onwards. Starting at6 value1100; add200=1300; +400=1700;+300=2000;+600=2600 exactly stones6-10 inclusive: 1100,200,400,300,600.

Remaining stones 11-12 and wrap to start1? sum remaining: 1000+700+900 =2600. Good! So cuts between stone5|6 and stone10|11. Thus positions after 5th stone and after 10th stone.

# Answer

**Where to cut**

Cut the necklace just *after* the 5‑th stone and again *after* the 10‑th stone.

---

### Why this works

1. **Total value of the necklace**

\[
900+1200+100+500+800+1100+200+400+300+600+1000+700 = 7\,800
\]

Each of the three pieces must therefore be worth  

\[
\frac{7\,800}{3}=2\,600 .
\]

2. **Finding a segment that sums to 2 600**

Starting at stone 2:

* \(1200 + 100 + 500 + 800 = 2600\)

So the first piece can be stones 2–5.

3. **Second segment**

After stone 5 we start at stone 6:

* \(1100 + 200 + 400 + 300 + 600 = 2600\)

Thus the second piece is stones 6–10.

4. **Third (remaining) segment**

The remaining stones are 11, 12 and then wrap around to 1:

* \(1000 + 700 + 900 = 2600\)

So the third piece is stones 11–12 followed by stone 1.

Hence cutting after stone 5 and after stone 10 divides the necklace into three strands each worth exactly **2,600**.
