# Thinking

We need to interpret problem: We have a necklace with stones values in sequence: [900,1200,100,500,800,1100,200,400,300,600,1000,700] and it's circular (loop back). We want to break the necklace at three places (i.e., cut into three contiguous segments) such that the total value of each segment is equal. Find where to cut.

Essentially find indices i<j<k in [1..12] such that sums from 1->i, i+1->j, j+1->k and k+1->(i-1 mod n) are equal? Since necklace loop. Equivalent: we need partition of cyclic sequence into 3 contiguous segments with equal sum. The total sum S = sum all values. Let's compute.

Use quick mental addition:

900+1200=2100
+100=2200
+500=2700
+800=3500
+1100=4600
+200=4800
+400=5200
+300=5500
+600=6100
+1000=7100
+700=7800

Total S = 7800. Divide by 3 => each segment sum must be 2600.

We need contiguous segments of total 2600 in circular order.

Let's find cumulative sums from start: prefix sums:

index 1 value 900 -> cum 900
2 +1200=2100
3 +100=2200
4 +500=2700
5 +800=3500
6 +1100=4600
7 +200=4800
8 +400=5200
9 +300=5500
10 +600=6100
11 +1000=7100
12 +700=7800

Now we need to find positions where cumulative sum difference equals 2600.

We look for i such that prefix[i] - prefix[start-1] = 2600. Starting at index 1? But because circular, we can choose any starting point. Equivalent: find indices a,b,c such that sums between them equal 2600 each.

Let’s search contiguous segments of sum 2600.

From start:

Indices 1-4 sum = 2700 > 2600; so need shorter: indices 1-3 sum=2200 <2600; 1-4 too big. So starting at 1 cannot get exactly 2600 within first few? Let's check: 900+1200+100+500=2700 too high, 900+1200+100=2200; need 400 more but next is 800, too large. So not possible from start.

Try starting at index2 (value1200). Cumulative sum from 2: 1200+100+500+800? 1200+100=1300; +500=1800; +800=2600 exactly! So indices 2-5 sum to 2600. Good segment1: 1200,100,500,800.

Then next segment should also be 2600 starting at index6 (1100). Let's compute from 6: 1100+200=1300; +400=1700; +300=2000; +600=2600 exactly! So indices6-10 sum to 2600. Good.

Remaining segment: indices11-12 and wrap around to before index2? Actually we cut at 3 places, segments are contiguous: first from 2 to5, second 6 to10, third rest: 11-12 then 1? Wait we started at index2; our segmentation as per necklace starting at index1 maybe different. But with circular cuts, segments must be contiguous in order along circle. Suppose we cut after indices5 and 10 and before 2 (or after 1). Let's define segments:

Segment A: indices 2-5 (1200+100+500+800 =2600)
Segment B: indices6-10 (1100+200+400+300+600=2600)
Segment C: remaining indices11,12,1? Because we started at index2. Let's compute remaining values: indices11(1000)+12(700)+1(900) sum = 1000+700+900 = 2600! Great.

Thus cuts are after stone 5 and 10 and before stone 2 (or equivalently between stones 1-2, 5-6, 10-11). So cut points: between 1&2, between5&6, between10&11. The segments: [1200,100,500,800], [1100,200,400,300,600], [1000,700,900].

Thus answer.

We can present as "cut after the stone worth 500 (i.e., between 500 and 800), after the stone worth 600 (between 600 and 1000) and after the stone worth 900 (between 900 and 1200)."

Let's produce explanation.

# Answer

**Goal**

Cut the necklace in three places so that each of the three resulting strands has exactly the same total value.

---

### 1.  Total value of the whole necklace  

\[
900+1200+100+500+800+1100+200+400+300+600+1000+700 = 7800
\]

For the three pieces to have equal value each piece must sum to

\[
\frac{7800}{3}=2600
\]

---

### 2.  Find contiguous blocks of value = 2600  

We walk around the necklace and look for groups of consecutive stones whose values add up to 2600.

| Start index | Stones (value) | Sum |
|-------------|----------------|-----|
| 1 | 900,1200,… | … |
| **2** | **1200,100,500,800** | **2600** |
| **6** | **1100,200,400,300,600** | **2600** |
| Remaining | 1000,700,900 | 2600 |

- Starting at stone 2 (value 1200) the first four stones give  
  \(1200+100+500+800 = 2600\).
- Starting immediately after that, at stone 6 (value 1100), the next five stones give  
  \(1100+200+400+300+600 = 2600\).
- The remaining three stones (values 1000, 700, 900) also sum to 2600.

Thus we have found three contiguous segments whose sums are all equal to 2600.

---

### 3.  Where to cut

The cuts must be made just before the first stone of each segment:

1. **Between 900 and 1200** – this separates the last part (1000, 700, 900) from the rest.
2. **Between 500 and 800** – ends the first segment \(1200,100,500,800\).
3. **Between 600 and 1000** – ends the second segment \(1100,200,400,300,600\).

---

### Result

Cutting the necklace between the stones with values:

- **900 & 1200**,
- **500 & 800**, and
- **600 & 1000**

produces three strands each worth **2600**.  

(Any cyclic shift of these cuts would work, but this is one convenient description.)
