# Question

"I have this old necklace, but the thing is, it's not really my taste anymore. So I decided to sell it, but when I was getting appraised the other day, I realized something weird.

"Each stone is worth a different amount, but if I break the necklace in three places, the three gem strands will be worth the same amount as one another. Can you believe it? Here, see if you can figure out where you gotta cut it to make that happen."

Each stone's value on the necklace is: 900, 1200, 100, 500, 800, 1100, 200, 400, 300, 600, 1000, 700. The final stone worthy of 700 loops back to the first stone worthy of 900.
