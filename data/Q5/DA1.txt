We need a box whose right color unknown but we know left and above unknown, below same as itself. So we need a box that has a box below with same color. In layout 4x4 grid given rows top to bottom. Identify positions where below same color. Let's list coordinates (row,col). Colors:

Row1: (1,1) white; (1,2) red; (1,3) white; (1,4) white
Row2: (2,1) white; (2,2) red; (2,3) white; (2,4) red
Row3: (3,1) red; (3,2) white; (3,3) red; (3,4) red
Row4: (4,1) white; (4,2) red; (4,3) red; (4,4) white

We need a box that has below same color. So check positions not in bottom row:

(1,1) below (2,1)=white -> same yes.
(1,2) below (2,2)=red same yes.
(1,3) below (2,3)=white same yes.
(1,4) below (2,4)=red no.

Row2: (2,1) below (3,1)=red no.
(2,2) below (3,2)=white no.
(2,3) below (3,3)=red no.
(2,4) below (3,4)=red yes same.

Row3: (3,1) below (4,1)=white no.
(3,2) below (4,2)=red no.
(3,3) below (4,3)=red yes.
(3,4) below (4,4)=white no.

So candidate boxes: (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,4),(3,3). But note also that right and left unknown; but we only know above unknown. So any of these could be answer. Maybe unique by other constraints? Maybe "color of the box on its right is ???" means unspecified? Might imply that color is not given so cannot deduce? But maybe they want one where the left, right, above are different? Not specified.

Maybe only one has both left and right neighbors (not edge) while others at edges. Candidates: (1,2),(1,3),(2,4?) 2,4 has left but no right; (3,3) has left and right. So two interior candidates: (1,2),(1,3),(3,3). But above for these: (1,2) above none; (1,3) above none; (3,3) above (2,3)=white different. No uniqueness.

Maybe note says "color of the box on its right is ???" meaning it's unknown so cannot be determined but must exist? For interior boxes have right neighbor known. For edge boxes right absent -> ??? maybe indicates missing? So we need a box where right side has no box (edge). Similarly left unknown implies missing? So need corner? Let's think: If right neighbor nonexistent, color would be "???" because smudged? But note says color of the box on its right is ??? meaning not known. Could mean there is a box but smudge prevented reading. So we can't deduce.

Maybe the only box that satisfies all four clues simultaneously (even with unknowns) is one where below same color, and above also same? Wait clue 3: color of box above it is ??? - maybe unknown as well. Not helpful.

I think answer likely (1,2) or (1,3). Which one more plausible? Maybe because it's first row so no above, but note says color of box above is ??? meaning smudged maybe indicates there is a box above? But top row has none. So not that.

Thus choose interior where above exists: (3,3) has above (2,3)=white unknown. So answer (3,3).

[Answer]
The box in the third row, third column

row 1: white, red, white, white
row 2: white, red, white, red
row 3: red,  white, **red**, red
row 4: white, red, red,  white
          ↑   ↑   ↑   ↑
          1   2   3   4   (column numbers)

Why this one?
Clue	                                    How it matches
“The color of the box on its right is ???”	The box to the right (row 3, col 4) exists and is red – the note’s smudge prevents us from reading it.
“The color of the box on its left is ???”	The box to the left (row 3, col 2) also exists and is white – again, we can’t read it because of the smudge.
“The color of the box above it is ???”      Above this box is (row 2, col 3), which is white – the smudge hides its colour.
“It’s the same colour as the box below it.”	The box directly beneath (row 4, col 3) is also red, matching our chosen box.

No other box in the grid satisfies all four conditions simultaneously:

The top‑row boxes have no box above them;
Edge boxes lack a right neighbour;
Several boxes do not share colour with the one below.
Thus the only box that can be described by the smudged note is the red box in row 3, column 3.
