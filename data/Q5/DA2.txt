We have a stack of 16 boxes arranged in a 4x4 grid. The note says:

The color of the box on its right is ??? (unknown)
The color of the box on its left is ???
The color of the box above it is ???
It's the same color as the box below it.
We need to find which box meets this description. Since the note's details are smudged, we only know these constraints? It says "The color of the box on its right is ???" meaning unknown; same for left and above. So those colors are not specified. The only clue is that it's the same color as the box below it.

But maybe also there is some hidden pattern: maybe the note originally had specific colors, but smudged, leaving placeholders ???. We need to deduce which box has same color as box below. That means we look for boxes whose below neighbor has same color. In grid, bottom row has no below. So only rows 1-3 have below neighbors.

We must find which boxes satisfy that they share the same color with the one directly below them. But maybe also need uniqueness? Let's list positions coordinates (row,column). Grid:

Row1: col1 white, col2 red, col3 white, col4 white
Row2: col1 white, col2 red, col3 white, col4 red
Row3: col1 red, col2 white, col3 red, col4 red
Row4: col1 white, col2 red, col3 red, col4 white

We need boxes where color same as below. Let's check each position row 1-3:

(1,1) white, below (2,1) white -> same => qualifies.
(1,2) red, below (2,2) red -> same => qualifies.
(1,3) white, below (2,3) white -> same => qualifies.
(1,4) white, below (2,4) red -> different.

Row2:
(2,1) white, below (3,1) red -> diff
(2,2) red, below (3,2) white -> diff
(2,3) white, below (3,3) red -> diff
(2,4) red, below (3,4) red -> same => qualifies.

Row3:
(3,1) red, below (4,1) white -> diff
(3,2) white, below (4,2) red -> diff
(3,3) red, below (4,3) red -> same => qualifies.
(3,4) red, below (4,4) white -> diff

So qualifiers: positions: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,3). Five boxes.

But maybe we need one box that matches all four conditions? But left/right/above unknown. So the only condition is same color as below. However perhaps there are multiple and we need more info: The note's smudged but maybe indicates the colors of right, left, above are known but smudged; maybe they were different? Not sure.

Maybe the puzzle expects that there's exactly one box that shares its color with the box below it AND is not on edge (so has left/right/above neighbors). Among qualifiers, which ones have all three other sides present? Let's check each:

(1,1) top row: above none; so maybe invalid because note says "color of the box above it is ???" but could be unknown. But still might exist.

But maybe they want a non-edge box (so has left/right/above). Let's see qualifiers with row 2-3 and col2-3? (1,1) top-left corner; (1,2) top row; (1,3) top row; (2,4) rightmost column; (3,3) interior. Only (3,3) is interior with left/right/above/below all present. So maybe that one.

Also note: The description says "The color of the box on its right is ???" meaning maybe unspecified but could be any color? That doesn't give constraints. Similarly left and above unknown. So we can't deduce which specific box unless using uniqueness assumption. Since only (3,3) has all four sides present; maybe the note implies that those colors are visible, though smudged.

Thus answer: The box at row 3, column 3 (third row, third column). Let's confirm color: it's red. It is same color as below (row4,col3) which is also red. So yes.

Thus answer.

[Answer]
The only box that can satisfy the note while still having a left, right and above neighbour (the other clues are “???” so they give no restriction) is the one in row 3, column 3 of the grid.

Row	1	    2	    3	    4
1	white	red	    white	white
2	white	red	    white	red
3	red	    white	red	    red
4	white	red	    red	    white

The box in (3, 3) is red.
Its colour matches the box directly below it at (4, 3), which is also red.

All other boxes that share a colour with the one beneath them are on an edge or corner and therefore lack either a left/right/above neighbour. Thus the unique candidate is the red box in row 3, column 3.
