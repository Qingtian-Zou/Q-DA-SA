# Thinking

We have a 4x4 stack? The layout given: presumably rows top to bottom. Let's index positions (row,column) from top-left. Provided 16 boxes: first row: white, red, white, white. Second: white, red, white, red. Third: red, white, red, red. Fourth: white, red, red, white.

We need a box such that:

- Color of the box on its right is ??? (unknown). So we cannot deduce? maybe it's blank? Actually smudged so unknown. But maybe "???".

But we only know relative info. Let's denote unknown colors for neighbors left/right/above/below. We have condition: same color as the box below it. So target's color equals below neighbor's color. Also we might need to consider edges: if box at bottom, there's no below; can't satisfy. So must not be bottom row.

Also maybe conditions about right and left colors are unknown - cannot help. But we also may deduce from layout that there is some unique pair of boxes with same color as below neighbor. Let's find positions where the box equals color of below.

Compute for each position (i,j) except bottom row:

Row1: 4 columns

Position(1,1): white, below (2,1)=white -> same yes
Pos(1,2): red, below (2,2)=red -> same yes
Pos(1,3): white, below (2,3)=white -> same yes
Pos(1,4): white, below (2,4)=red -> not same

Row2: positions except bottom row?

But we exclude bottom row. For row2:

(2,1): white, below (3,1)=red no
(2,2): red, below (3,2)=white no
(2,3): white, below (3,3)=red no
(2,4): red, below (3,4)=red yes

Row3:

(3,1): red, below (4,1)=white no
(3,2): white, below (4,2)=red no
(3,3): red, below (4,3)=red yes
(3,4): red, below (4,4)=white no

So boxes with same color as below: positions: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,3). That's five possibilities.

But we also have conditions about left and right colors unknown. But maybe note says "The color of the box on its right is ???" meaning smudged can't be determined but still we know it's some color? Might be unspecified, so cannot deduce uniqueness.

Maybe there is additional constraint: The smudged notes refer to "color" maybe could be same/different etc. But they are unknown? Might interpret as we don't know them but might not need.

But there might also be assumption that all other boxes colors are known and unique? We can compute left/right/above for each candidate; check if any contradictions with layout e.g., the right box may have color equal to something else etc. But since smudged, we can't use.

Wait maybe "???" indicates unknown but could be deduced by comparing to known boxes? Eg color of box on its right is ??? meaning we don't know but maybe it's not white/red? Actually there are only white and red in layout. So either color could be white or red. But no other colors present. So "color of the box on its right is ???" indicates unknown (could be white or red). Similarly left, above.

Thus any candidate works as long as condition "same color as below" holds. That gives 5 boxes.

But maybe they also expect that note had smudged but we can deduce from layout which one fits pattern: The note likely described all four neighbors colors but we only see ??? for right/left/above; meaning those values were smudged and not legible, whereas the same color as below is visible? Actually the note maybe had scribbles that are still readable: "It's the same color as the box below it." So that clue is present. The others are smudged so unknown.

Thus any box with same color as below qualifies but we need unique answer. Maybe we also consider that the stack of 16 boxes could be arranged such that each row/column may have some property like alternating etc. But maybe only one pair of adjacent boxes share color vertically and horizontally? Wait (1,1) white above white; left none; right red. (2,4) red below red; left red; above red. Let's analyze more.

Maybe the smudged note indicates that the box on its right is ??? meaning there is some specific property like "black" maybe but unknown. But we can't deduce.

Let's think of possible reasoning: The puzzle likely expects that only one box has same color as below AND also its left or right or above colors satisfy certain conditions deducible from layout? For instance, if right is smudged, we cannot determine but maybe we can still use relative counts to find unique answer. Eg perhaps the note was originally "the color of the box on its right is the same as the color of the box on its left" or something. But we only see ??? for right/left/above because those are smudged but still might be read? Hmm.

Could interpret that the note had words like "The color of the box on its right is ???" meaning unknown, but maybe it could be white or red. But nothing else.

Maybe the puzzle intends that we need to find a box whose adjacent boxes satisfy something inherent: For any such candidate, the left/right/above colors are determined by layout; we can compute them and see if they match some pattern of smudged note? Eg if right color unknown, but maybe the note had "the color of the box on its right is ???" meaning we can't know. But that's irrelevant.

But still there are 5 possibilities. Could any be eliminated by considering that the note's smudging means you cannot see it but the colors might differ from others? Not helpful.

Let's analyze each candidate:

(1,1): white; below white same. Left none. Right (1,2)=red. Above none.
(1,2): red; below red; left white; right white; above none.
(1,3): white; below white; left red; right white; above none.
(2,4): red; below red; left white; right none; above (1,4)=white
(3,3): red; below red; left white; right red; above (2,3)=white

All have same color as below.

If we consider also that note maybe had "The color of the box on its right is ???" but we don't know which one. But maybe only some boxes have unique neighbor colors? Eg (1,2) has left white right white above none; while others vary.

Maybe we could think about uniqueness: Which candidate's neighbors' colors include both red and white? For (3,3): left white, right red, above white, below red. Balanced. Others have some missing neighbors.

But perhaps the note was smudged only for certain directions because they are at edge? Eg if a box is on rightmost column, right neighbor absent; maybe smudge indicates none. But here (2,4) and (1,4) have no right neighbor but note still had ??? maybe meaning nothing? Not.

Let's reconsider problem: "You have been told to get one of 16 boxes from a stack. The note that describes which box to grab is smudged, so this is all you can make of the details:

-The color of the box on its right is ???
-The color of the box on its left is ???
-The color of the box above it is ???
-It's the same color as the box below it.

Here is the layout of the 16 boxes:
white, red, white, white
white, red, white, red
red, white, red, red
white, red, red, white

Which one box meets this description?"

So maybe the note says only that its right/left/above colors are unknown; but we know it's same color as below. So just need to find boxes that satisfy being same color as below. But maybe also they must have known neighbors? But we don't know them.

Wait, perhaps there is assumption: The smudged note originally said something like "The color of the box on its right is ___." but we cannot read; however we might infer from layout that if a candidate's right neighbor has same color as below maybe not. I'm overthinking.

Let's consider maybe only one box in stack satisfies that it's same color as below and also is not at edge? Because left/right/above unknown could be any, but note had smudge; but maybe the smudged part is on top of the stack, so you can't read all sides? Eh.

Let's analyze positions with same below that are interior (not edges). Interiors: Not first or last column, not first row, not last row. Candidate positions interior: (2,2) not same, (2,3) no, (3,2) no, etc. The only interior ones with same below are (3,3) maybe? Because it's second to last column and third row: left, right, above, below all exist. Others (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) at top row so above missing; (2,4) at rightmost column; so interior candidate only (3,3). That might be unique answer.

Thus likely the intended answer is box at position third row, third column.

Let's craft explanation: Because only one box has same color as below and all four neighbors exist. But note didn't say anything about edges but smudged, maybe not relevant. So answer: The red box in the third row, third column (3rd from left of 2nd-from-bottom row) because it's same color as the box below it.

Alternatively could be white at (1,3)? But interior only one candidate is (3,3). Provide final explanation accordingly.

Let's produce answer.

# Answer

**The red box in the third row, third column**  

(That is, the middle‑right “red” box of the lower‑half of the stack.)

---

### Why that one?

1. **Same color as the box below it**  
   * The only way to satisfy the clue “It’s the same colour as the box below it” is for the chosen box and the one directly under it to have identical colours.

2. **Check every possible position**

| Position (row, column) | Colour | Box immediately below | Same colour? |
|------------------------|--------|-----------------------|--------------|
| 1‑1 | white | 2‑1 → white | ✔ |
| 1‑2 | red   | 2‑2 → red   | ✔ |
| 1‑3 | white | 2‑3 → white | ✔ |
| 1‑4 | white | 2‑4 → red   | ✘ |
| 2‑1 | white | 3‑1 → red   | ✘ |
| 2‑2 | red   | 3‑2 → white | ✘ |
| 2‑3 | white | 3‑3 → red   | ✘ |
| 2‑4 | red   | 3‑4 → red   | ✔ |
| **3‑1** | red | 4‑1 → white | ✘ |
| **3‑2** | white | 4‑2 → red | ✘ |
| **3‑3** | **red** | **4‑3 → red** | **✔** |
| 3‑4 | red | 4‑4 → white | ✘ |

There are five boxes that satisfy “same colour as the box below it” – (1‑1), (1‑2), (1‑3), (2‑4) and **(3‑3)**.

3. **Which one can we actually grab?**

The smudged note does not tell us anything about the colours on the left, right or above, but it also doesn’t give us a reason to prefer an edge box over an interior one.  
However, only one of those five boxes is *fully surrounded* – that is, it has neighbours on all four sides:

- **(3‑3)** (red) has a neighbour on its left (4), right (2), above (1) and below (4).

The other candidates are either on the top row, right edge or have missing neighbours.

Because the note does not contradict having any of these missing neighbours, the only box that is *unambiguously* identified by the clue “same colour as the box below it” **and** has a full set of adjacent boxes (matching the way the stack was laid out) is the red box in row 3, column 3.

So you should grab **the third‑row, third‑column red box**.
