This question seems tricky: we are in a rather ambiguous situation where everyone could be lying.
Let's start with the concrete condition we have: the culprit must be lying.
With this in mind, B's statement becomes interesting: it is a confession!
However, if B is truly the culprit, then B should be lying, which means B should not be the culprit as B's confession should not be trusted.
It is self-contradicting!
Therefore, B is not the culprit and B is lying.
Now that we know B is innocent, D is telling the truth, so D is not the culprit, either.

Similarly, C says that A did not do anything.
If C is the culprit, then C should be lying, which means that A surely did something.
However, we should have only one culprit.
Therefore, C is not the culprit.
The only person left, A, is the culprit.

Finally, let's check the answer we get.
If A is the culprit, A should be lying.
A claims that "I am not the culprit", so it is surely a lie.
The condition is met.
As for other's statements, because they can freely tell the truth or lie, there is no point in examining their statements.

In conclusion, A is the culprit.
