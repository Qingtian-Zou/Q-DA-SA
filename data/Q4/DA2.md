# Thinking

Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step. So we have four kids: A, B, C, D. One of them broke the window, and that scamp is lying. The rest might be lying too, but we need to find who the liar is (since only the culprit is definitely lying, others could be lying or telling truth). Wait, actually the problem says "the scamp who broke your window is lying". So exactly one person is lying? Wait no: "You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying. However, an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well."

Hmm, so the culprit (the one who broke it) is definitely lying. The others might be lying or telling truth; we don't know how many. So our job is to figure out which one of them is the culprit (since that's the only one who must be lying), and also check whether their statements are consistent with that.

Let me write down each person's statement:

A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" So A is saying he's innocent.

B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." B claims he did it.

C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" C says A is innocent.

D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear." D says B didn't do it.

We need to find who is lying (the culprit), and check if all statements are consistent with that.

Let's consider each possibility one by one.

Case 1: Suppose A is the culprit (liar). Then:

- A lied: so A did break it. Good, since we assumed A is guilty.

Now, let's see other statements.

B says "It was me." So B is lying here? Wait, no: if A is guilty, then B's statement is false, so B would be lying. But the problem states that only the culprit is definitely lying (the others may lie or tell truth). Wait, no: wait, the problem says "the scamp who broke your window is lying". So only the culprit must be a liar; others could be lying or truthful. Wait, but in reality, if someone else lied, then they are also liars, but we don't know how many.

Wait, actually the problem states: "You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying." So exactly one person is guilty (the culprit), and that person is lying. The rest may or may not be lying; we don't have information about their truthfulness beyond what they say.

But in this puzzle, since it's a logic puzzle, probably only one of them is the culprit (liar) and others are telling the truth or maybe some others lie too. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps all the other statements must be consistent with exactly one liar (the culprit), but actually no: problem says "an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well". So there could be more than one liar (but only the culprit is definitely a liar; others are possibly liars). Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, the key here might be that in logic puzzles like this, usually exactly one person is guilty and they lie, and everyone else tells the truth. But the problem says "an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well", which suggests that there could be more liars (but only the culprit is definitely a liar). Hmm.

Wait, maybe not. Let's try to parse again:

"You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying." So whoever did it must be lying. "However, an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well." So others could lie or tell truth; we don't know.

So our job: figure out which one of them is the culprit (the liar), given that only that person must be a liar (others could lie too but maybe not necessarily). But since it's a puzzle, likely there's a unique solution where if you assume X is guilty, then all statements are consistent with only X being the liar (or some number of liars, but the culprit is definitely lying).

Wait, perhaps we need to find which person must be the liar (the culprit) such that the rest's statements don't contradict.

Let me try each possibility.

Case 1: A did it.

Then A lied. B says "It was me". Since A did it, B's statement is false. So B is lying. But according to problem, only the culprit must be lying. Wait, but here we have two liars (A and B). But the problem states that "the scamp who broke your window is lying" (so at least one liar) and others may lie too. Hmm, so it's possible that there are more than one liar.

But maybe in this puzzle, only the culprit is lying. Wait, but the problem says "an unknown number of the other children may be lying", which implies that others might lie or not. So we have to find who is the culprit such that their statement is a lie (which it has to be), and the rest's statements are either true or lies (but given that there's only one culprit).

Wait, perhaps the key is that in order for this puzzle to have a solution, only one person must be lying (the culprit). But problem says "an unknown number of other children may be lying as well", so maybe more than one. Hmm.

Let me try each case.

Case 1: A did it.

A lies ("Not me!"), correct.

B says "It was me" – false, so B lies.

C says "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" But in this case, C is lying too (since A did do it). So C lies.

D says "B didn't break the glass". Since A did it, B didn't. So D's statement is true.

So in this scenario: A (liar), B (liar), C (liar), D (truthful). But problem states only the culprit must be lying; here three people are lying. Maybe possible? Hmm. The puzzle says "an unknown number of others may be lying", so multiple liars is allowed, but we need to see which case gives a consistent scenario.

Case 2: B did it.

Then B is lying (since he said "It was me", which would be true if he did it... Wait no. Wait, hold on: If B is the culprit, then his statement "It was me" is true. But problem says the scamp who broke the window is lying. So that's a contradiction. Because if B did it, he must be lying, but he claims to have done it – which would be a lie? Wait no:

Wait, if someone says "I did it", and they are guilty, then they are lying (if their statement is false). Wait no: If the person is guilty, then saying "I did it" would be true. But according to problem: "the scamp who broke your window is lying". So culprit's statement must be a lie.

Wait, this seems critical.

Let me think carefully.

If someone breaks the window (culprit), they are the one lying. So their statement is false.

So for example, if B did it, then his statement "It was me" would be a lie. But that doesn't make sense because if he's the culprit, he would have to say something false. Wait, but in this case, B says "It was me". If he actually did it, then saying "it was me" is true, which contradicts that he's lying.

Ah! This is important.

So here's the key: The culprit lied. Therefore, whatever they said must be a lie. So if someone claims to have done something (or not), their statement being a lie means the opposite.

Therefore:

If B says "It was me", then if B is lying, it wasn't him. Conversely, if B is truthful, he did it.

But in our problem: The culprit is the one who's lying. So culprit's statement is false.

So for each person:

A: claims not to have done it. If A is lying, then A did do it.

B: claims he did it. If B is lying, then he didn't do it.

C: claims A didn't do it. If C is lying, then A did do it.

D: claims B didn't do it. If D is lying, then B did do it.

Given that exactly one person is the culprit (liar), and others may or may not lie.

Wait, but problem says "an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well". So multiple liars possible beyond the culprit.

But we need to find who the culprit is such that:

- Their statement is a lie (so they are guilty)

And the rest's statements can either be true or lies (but we don't have info on others), but in order for the scenario to hold with only one liar? Wait, no. The problem says "the scamp who broke your window is lying", so at least that one liar; others could lie too.

But given that it's a puzzle, likely only one person is guilty and the rest are telling truth (but problem allows others to lie). Hmm.

Wait, let's try again with this critical point:

If someone is lying, their statement is false. So culprit's statement is false.

Let's consider each possibility:

Case 1: A is culprit.

Then A lied ("Not me" → A did it).

B says "It was me". Since A did it, B's statement is false → B lied.

C says "A didn't do it". Which is false (since A did), so C lied.

D says "B didn't break glass". True (A did), so D tells truth.

So in this case: 3 liars (A,B,C). But problem allows others to lie. Hmm, possible? Maybe.

Case 2: B is culprit.

Then B lied. So his statement "It was me" → false, meaning he didn't do it. Contradiction! Because we assumed he did it. Therefore, impossible.

Wait, this is a key point. If B claims to have done it (B's statement), and if B is lying, then the negation is "it was not me". So culprit cannot be B? Wait:

Wait, hold on. If the culprit must be lying, then:

If someone says X, their lie means ¬X.

So for B: B says "I broke it" (B's statement). So if B is liar, then he didn't break it. But we are assuming B did it. Contradiction. Therefore, B cannot be the culprit.

Wait, that seems important.

Let me formalize:

Let’s denote:

A: ¬A (A didn't do it)

B: B (B did it)

C: ¬A

D: ¬B

The culprit is the one who lied.

So:

- If culprit = A: then A's statement (¬A) is false → correct, so A did it.

- If culprit = B: then B's statement (B) must be false → so B did not do it. But we assumed B did, contradiction. Therefore, B cannot be the culprit.

Ah! This is a critical point I missed earlier.

Therefore, Case 2 where B is culprit is impossible because if B were guilty, his statement would have to be a lie ("It was me" → lie means he didn't do it), which contradicts him being the culprit. So B cannot be the one who did it.

That's important.

Similarly:

Case 3: C is culprit.

C says "A didn't do it". If C is lying, then A did do it. But we're assuming C did it, not A. Wait, no:

Wait, culprit = C. Then C lied. So his statement ("A didn't do it") is false → so A did do it. Therefore, if C is the culprit (lying), that would mean A did it. Which contradicts C being the culprit.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's do each case carefully.

General rule: For each person X:

If X is the culprit (liar), then their statement S_X is false.

Therefore:

- If culprit = A: A's statement ¬A → false ⇒ A did it. Okay.

- culprit = B: B's statement B → false ⇒ B didn't do it. Contradiction, so impossible.

- culprit = C: C's statement ¬A → false ⇒ A did it. But we're assuming C is culprit, so contradiction (because if C is culprit then A did not do it). Wait:

Wait, hold on. If culprit is C, meaning C is the one who broke the window, but according to logic above, if C is lying (which he must be), then his statement ¬A ("A didn't do it") is false ⇒ A did it. So that would mean both C and A are guilty? But problem states only one kid broke the window.

Ah! Here's another key point: The problem says "one of them threw a ball right through your window". So exactly one culprit.

Therefore, if we suppose someone is the culprit (liar), their statement being false leads to some conclusion. If that conclusion contradicts the assumption that only one person did it, then that case is invalid.

Let's redo each case properly with this in mind.

Case 1: A is culprit.

A lied ⇒ his statement "I didn't do it" is false ⇒ he did it (consistent).

B said "It was me". Since A did it, B's statement is false. So B lied.

C said "A didn't do it" → which is false (since A did), so C lied.

D said "B didn't break glass" → true (since A did), so D told truth.

So in this case: culprit = A; liars = A, B, C. But problem states only the culprit must be lying (others may lie too). So possible? The puzzle says "an unknown number of others may lie", so multiple liars allowed.

Case 2: B is culprit.

As above, if B is culprit, then his statement "I did it" must be a lie ⇒ he didn't do it. Contradiction. Impossible.

Case 3: C is culprit.

C lied ⇒ his statement "A didn't do it" is false ⇒ A did do it.

But we assumed C is the culprit (the only one who broke window), but according to this, A also did it. Which contradicts exactly one culprit. Therefore invalid.

Case 4: D is culprit.

D lied ⇒ his statement "B didn't break glass" is false ⇒ B did break it.

So if D is culprit, then B is the actual culprit (since D's lie implies B did it). But this would mean two culprits? No, problem states one kid broke window. Contradiction. Wait:

Wait, no: If D is lying, then "B didn't break glass" is false ⇒ B did break it. So if we assume D is culprit (liar), then according to his lie, B actually did it. But that would mean both D and B are culprits? Not possible.

Wait, this is confusing.

Let me rephrase:

If the culprit is someone X, then X's statement is false.

We have to find X such that:

- If X = A: A's statement ¬A is false ⇒ A did it (okay)

- If X = B: B's statement B is false ⇒ B didn't do it. Contradiction (we assumed he did), so impossible

- If X = C: C's statement ¬A is false ⇒ A did it. But then two culprits? Wait, no: If we assume that C is the culprit (liar), then according to his lie, A did it. So actually, A would be the real culprit, not C. Therefore, this case leads to inconsistency.

Similarly:

- X = D: D's statement ¬B is false ⇒ B did it. So if D is liar (culprit), then B is the real culprit. But we assumed D is culprit; contradiction.

Therefore, only possible case is Case 1: A is culprit.

Wait, but let's verify.

If we suppose X = A:

- A lied (good)

- B lied (says he did it, but A did it)

- C lied (said A didn't do it)

- D told truth

But problem says "an unknown number of others may be lying". So three liars? Hmm. But the puzzle might expect only one liar, but according to the problem statement, multiple can lie.

Wait, but wait another angle: The problem says "the scamp who broke your window is lying" (so culprit lies), and "an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well". So others could lie or not. We need to find who must be the culprit such that all statements are consistent with only one liar? Wait, no.

Wait, in Case 1: A is culprit. Then:

A lied (required)

B's statement is false ⇒ B lied

C's statement is false ⇒ C lied

D's statement true

So three liars total. But problem doesn't say there's only one liar; it says the culprit is lying (and others may or may not). So this could be possible.

Case 3: Let's see again. If we thought someone else:

Wait, Case 4: Suppose D is culprit.

Then D lied ⇒ B did break glass.

But then B would be guilty, which conflicts with D being the culprit. So inconsistency.

Similarly for C: If C is culprit, then A is guilty, so inconsistency.

B can't be.

So only possible case is A?

Wait, but wait another way. Let's suppose that there is only one liar (the culprit). The problem says "an unknown number of others may be lying", which could mean zero or more. If we assume only the culprit is lying (which might be what the puzzle expects), then:

Case 1: Only A lied.

Then B told truth ⇒ B did it. But if B did it, he's supposed to be truthful? Wait no.

Wait, if only culprit lies:

If culprit = A:

- A lies

- B tells truth ⇒ B did it (but we assumed A did it). Contradiction.

So that can't be.

Ah! Here's the key. If the puzzle assumes only one liar (the culprit), then:

Let's try this approach: Assume exactly one liar (culprit). Then check consistency.

Case 1: Only A lies.

Then:

A lied ⇒ A did it.

B tells truth ⇒ B did it. Contradiction (two culprits).

Invalid.

Case 2: Only B lies.

Then:

B lied ⇒ B didn't do it.

C and D tell truth.

C says A is innocent ⇒ true, so A didn't do it.

D says B didn't do it ⇒ true.

So if only B lied, then culprit must be someone else? Wait:

Wait, we're assuming only one liar (B), so culprit = B. But according to this, B lied ⇒ he didn't do it. Contradiction again. So impossible.

Case 3: Only C lies.

C lied ⇒ A did it.

Others tell truth.

A says "I didn't" → which would be a lie, but we assumed only C is lying. Contradiction (A would also be liar). Invalid.

Case 4: Only D lies.

D lied ⇒ B did it.

Others tell truth.

B said "it was me", so if B is truthful then he did it. Consistent with D's lie.

C says A didn't do it → true, so A innocent.

A says "I didn't" → true (since A innocent)

So in this case:

- D lied

- B told truth (so B did it)

This scenario has only one liar: D. Wait, but according to problem statement, the culprit is lying. Here, culprit is B (liar? No):

Wait, confusion arises.

Wait, if we assume that exactly one person is lying (the culprit), then:

If culprit = B.

But earlier we saw a problem here.

Wait, let's clarify:

If only D lied:

- D's lie implies B did it.

- B said "I did it", so he told truth ⇒ consistent with being culprit.

So in this scenario: B is culprit (told truth? Wait no! Wait the problem states that culprit is lying. So if B is culprit, he must be lying, but here we're saying B told truth.

Ah! This is the crucial point I was missing earlier.

The key: The culprit is the one who lied. Therefore, whoever did it must have lied. Therefore:

If B is the culprit, then his statement "I did it" must be a lie ⇒ he didn't do it. Contradiction. So B cannot be culprit.

But in the above scenario where only D lied:

- D lied (so culprit = ?)

Wait, no: If we have exactly one liar (D), then the culprit is this liar? No:

Wait, problem says: "the scamp who broke your window is lying". So the culprit is a liar. There may be other liars too.

But if we assume that only the culprit is lying, then:

Let’s try again with this constraint: exactly one liar (culprit).

So:

Case A: Only A lied (so A is culprit)

Then:

A lied ⇒ A did it

B tells truth ⇒ B did it. Contradiction.

Invalid.

Case B: Only B lied (B is culprit)

But B's statement "I did it" being a lie means he didn't do it. So culprit ≠ B. Invalid.

Case C: Only C lied (C is culprit)

C lied ⇒ A did it

A says "I didn't" ⇒ truth, so A innocent. Contradiction with above.

Invalid.

Case D: Only D lied (D is culprit)

D lied ⇒ B did it

B said "I did it", which would be true. So culprit = B, but we assumed culprit = D. Contradiction.

Wait, this approach isn't working.

Alternative idea:

Given that the culprit must have lied, so their statement is false.

We already saw that B cannot be culprit because if he were, his statement "I did it" would have to be a lie, making him innocent.

So culprit is A, C, or D.

Let's consider each again carefully.

Option 1: A broke window (liar)

- A's statement false ✔️

B's statement: "It was me". False ⇒ B lied.

C's statement: "A didn't do it". False ⇒ C lied.

D's statement: "B didn't break glass". True, since A did it.

So three liars. Possible per problem statement ("an unknown number of others may lie").

Option 2: C broke window (liar)

- C's statement false ⇒ A did it.

But we assumed C is culprit; however, this implies A also did it. Not possible. So invalid.

Option 3: D broke window (liar)

- D's statement false ⇒ B did it.

So if D lied, then B is the culprit. But culprit must be liar. However, in this case, B would have told truth ("I did it"), but the problem states that culprit is lying. Therefore, contradiction. So invalid.

Therefore, only possible option is A.

Wait, but according to this analysis, Option 1: A is culprit, three liars.

But wait, another angle: The problem says "the scamp who broke your window is lying". It doesn't say that others are not lying; so multiple liars allowed.

Given the above, only A can be the culprit without contradiction. B and C lead to contradictions, D leads to inconsistency with B being culprit (who would have told truth but must lie).

Wait, let's check Option 3 again:

If culprit is D.

Then D lied ⇒ B did it.

But then B is guilty, so B should be lying as per problem statement (since culprit lies). But in this case, if B did it, his statement "I did it" would be true. Contradiction: the culprit (B) must be lying, but he told truth. So inconsistency here.

Therefore, D cannot be culprit.

Similarly, C can't be.

So only A remains.

But wait, another check:

If A is guilty:

- A lied

- B said he did it → lie

- C said A didn't do it → lie

- D said B didn't do it → truth

This works with three liars. The problem allows that "an unknown number of others may be lying", so this is acceptable.

But wait, the puzzle says "you can figure out which one of these darned kids broke your window". So according to this analysis, A did it.

However, I've seen similar puzzles where the answer is D or B... Wait.

Wait, another thought. Let's suppose that there is only one liar (the culprit), even though problem says "unknown number". Maybe in the puzzle's context, they want us to assume only the culprit lies.

But according to strict analysis:

If we must have exactly one liar (culprit):

- B cannot be culprit (as explained)

- If A is culprit: requires B and C also lying ⇒ more than one liar. So invalid under "exactly one"

- If C is culprit: leads to A being culprit too ⇒ invalid

- D as culprit: implies B is culprit, but B would have told truth ⇒ invalid.

So if puzzle assumes exactly one liar (culprit), then there's no solution? But that can't be.

Hmm. This suggests maybe the problem expects multiple liars and the answer is A or D.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose we don't assume the number of liars beyond the culprit.

We have four statements:

A: ¬A (I didn't)

B: B

C: ¬A

D: ¬B

If we consider who the culprit could be with their statement being false.

As established, B cannot be culprit because his statement would have to be a lie ("I did it" → lie ⇒ he didn't do it), contradiction.

So culprit is A, C, or D.

Culprit = A:

A's statement ¬A → false. Good.

B's statement B: false (since A did it)

C's statement ¬A: false

D's statement ¬B: true

Consistent; three liars.

Culprit = C:

C's statement ¬A → false ⇒ A did it. But culprit is C, so two culprits? No.

Invalid.

Culprit = D:

D's statement ¬B → false ⇒ B did it. So culprit is B, but B must be lying. However, B says "I did it", which would be true if he did. Contradiction (since culprit must lie). So invalid.

Therefore only possible culprit is A.

But wait, I have a doubt because sometimes in these puzzles, the answer might be D. Wait:

Wait another angle: If we consider that when someone says "B didn't break it", and if B did break it, then D is lying. But also, if D is innocent (not culprit), then his statement's truthfulness depends.

But according to above analysis, only A works.

Wait, let's see an example:

If the answer is B, but we saw that B cannot be because he would have to lie and say he did it ⇒ contradiction.

Wait, suppose someone misreads the problem: If the culprit is lying, then their statement is false. So if B said "It was me", then if he's lying, he didn't do it. So to be guilty, he must have told truth? No:

No: The culprit lies. So guilty person's statement is a lie.

Therefore, for B: If he did it, his statement "I did" would be true, which contradicts him being a liar. Therefore, B cannot be culprit.

Similarly, if someone says something that would require them to be truthful if they are the culprit, then they can't be the culprit.

So only A, C, D possible as culprits (but with constraints).

Culprit = D:

D's lie ⇒ B did it. But then B must be lying as well (since he's the culprit), but B said "I did it" which would be true. Contradiction.

Therefore culprit can't be D.

Culprit = C:

C's lie ⇒ A did it. So only A is culprit, not C. Invalid.

Thus, only culprit possible is A.

But wait, let me check an outside source in mind... Classic puzzle like this: sometimes the answer is B, but no, here it seems different.

Wait, another way: Let's suppose that D is telling truth.

D says "B didn't break glass".

If D tells truth, then B is innocent.

Then culprit is A, C, or D.

But if D is truthful:

Case: If culprit = A.

A lied; B told truth? Wait no:

Wait if D is truthful (so B is innocent), then:

C says "A didn't do it". So if A is guilty, C lies.

B says "It was me" → lie.

So similar to before.

But the key here: If we can find a scenario with minimal liars or something.

Alternatively, let's see who must be lying.

Note that B and D are making statements about each other.

If we assume that only one person is lying (culprit), but as we saw it's impossible. So likely three liars as in A being culprit.

But maybe the problem has answer D?

Wait, wait: Wait another approach.

Let’s suppose that there is exactly one liar (the culprit).

As established, this leads to a problem because:

- If B were the liar (culprit), he would have to be lying about doing it ⇒ he didn't do it. So impossible.

If A is the only liar:

A lied ⇒ A did it.

B told truth ⇒ B did it. Contradiction.

If C is the only liar:

C lied ⇒ A did it.

But then A also lied (said "I didn't"), so two liars. Invalid.

If D is the only liar:

D lied ⇒ B did it.

B told truth ⇒ B did it. But then B must be lying (as culprit), contradiction.

So no solution with exactly one liar.

Therefore, problem must allow multiple liars.

Given that, back to earlier analysis: A is the only possible culprit without contradiction.

Wait, but hold on:

Wait, what if culprit = D?

D lied ⇒ B did it.

But then B is guilty and should be lying. But B said "I did it", which would be true. So inconsistency.

Unless... Wait a second.

Is there a possibility that the statements are not about who broke it, but something else? No, problem states: A says he didn't break anything (i.e., window), B says he broke it, etc.

Wait, here's a different thought. The problem says "one of them threw a ball right through your window". So the culprit is the one who threw the ball through the window (broke it). Now, could there be a case where someone else is lying about it?

But according to analysis, only A works.

Wait, let's try to see:

If D is truthful ("B didn't break it"), then B is innocent.

Then culprit must be A or C.

C says "A didn't do it". If culprit = A: then C lies. So statements:

A lies (guilty)

B lies (says he did)

C lies

D truth.

Consistent.

If culprit = C:

But C would have to lie, so his statement "A didn't" is false ⇒ A did. Contradiction with culprit=C.

So only possibility when D tells truth: culprit=A.

Alternatively, if D is lying ("B didn't break it"), so B did.

Then B must be guilty but he told the truth (said "I did"). But guilty person must lie. So inconsistency. Therefore, D cannot be lying; D must be truthful.

Wait a minute! This might be key.

If we assume that if D were lying, then B is culprit, but B would have to be lying too (since culprit lies), which contradicts B saying he did it truthfully. Therefore, D must be telling the truth.

Therefore, D: "B didn't break glass" → true ⇒ B is innocent.

This eliminates B as culprit.

So now we know B is innocent.

Given that:

A: "I didn't do it"

B: "It was me" (lie since B is innocent)

C: "A didn't do it"

D: "B didn't" (truthful, as established)

Now, the culprit must be A or C.

If culprit = A:

- A lied

- C said A didn't ⇒ lie

So both A and C lied. Possible.

If culprit = C:

- C lied ⇒ A did it. But we assumed culprit=C. Contradiction.

Therefore, only possibility is A.

Yes! This seems solid.

Here's the breakdown:

Since D's statement leads to B being innocent (because if D were lying, B would be guilty but then B would have told truth which he can't), therefore D must be truthful ⇒ B is innocent.

Given that, we look at A and C.

C says "A didn't do it". If A did it, C lied; else, C told truth.

But culprit is one of them.

If A is culprit:

- A lies

- C lies (since A did it)

Consistent.

If C is culprit:

- C must be lying ⇒ A did it. Contradiction with C being culprit.

Thus, only A can be the culprit.

This seems to be the solution.

The key insight was realizing that D must be telling the truth because if D were lying, we'd have a contradiction (B would have to both be guilty and truthful). So D is truthful ⇒ B is innocent. Then the only possible culprit left is A, with C also lying.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{A}

# Answer

To solve this logic puzzle, we must determine **which one of the four children broke the window**, given that:

- **The scamp who broke the window is lying**.
- **An unknown number of the other children may be lying as well.**

Let’s carefully analyze each child's statement and what it implies.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Understand the Statements

| Child | Statement |
|-------|-----------|
| A     | "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" |
| B     | "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." |
| C     | "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" |
| D     | "B didn't break the glass, I swear." |

We know:
- **Exactly one child** is guilty (the culprit).
- The **culprit is lying**.
- Other children may or may not be lying.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Analyze Each Possibility

Let’s test each child as a possible **guilty party (liar)** and see if the rest of the statements are consistent with that assumption.

#### 🔹 Case A: **A is guilty** (i.e., A lied)

- A says, "Not me!" → This is a **lie**, so **A did it**. ✅
- B says, "It was me." → Since A did it, this is a **lie** → B is lying.
- C says, "Don’t be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" → Since A *did* it, this is also a **lie** → C is lying.
- D says, "B didn't break the glass." → True (A did it), so **D told the truth**.

So in this case:
- A: liar ✅
- B: liar ✅
- C: liar ✅
- D: truthful ✅

This scenario is **completely consistent** with all statements. The only requirement is that the **culprit (A)** is lying — which he is. Other children may be lying too, as the problem allows for "an unknown number" of others to lie.

✅ **This case is valid and consistent.**

---

#### 🔹 Case B: **B is guilty** (i.e., B lied)

- B says, "It was me." → If he's **lying**, then **he didn't do it**.
- But we assumed **he did it** → contradiction.

❌ **This case is invalid.**

---

#### 🔹 Case C: **C is guilty** (i.e., C lied)

- C says, "A didn’t do anything." → If this is a lie, then **A did it**.
- So A would be the real culprit — but we assumed **C** was the one who broke it.

This leads to a **contradiction**: two culprits (A and C), which violates the problem's condition that only *one* child broke the window.

❌ **This case is invalid.**

---

#### 🔹 Case D: **D is guilty** (i.e., D lied)

- D says, "B didn't break the glass." → If this is a lie, then **B did it**.
- So B would be the real culprit — but we assumed **D** was the one who broke it.

This leads to a contradiction: two culprits (B and D), which again violates the problem's condition.

❌ **This case is invalid.**

---

### ✅ Step 3: Key Insight – Why D Must Be Truthful

Let’s take a deeper look at **D**:

- If D were **lying**, then B did it.
- But if B did it, he would have said "It was me," which would be **true** — but the **culprit must be lying**.

So this leads to a contradiction: B is guilty and telling the truth → invalid.

➡️ Therefore, **D must be telling the truth**, so **B is innocent**.

This is a crucial deduction that eliminates B as a possible culprit immediately.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Final Deduction

With D being truthful (so B is innocent), we're left with **A and C** as the only suspects.

- If A is guilty:
  - A lies → correct
  - C says, "A didn't do it" → lie → also consistent
  - B and D are both truthful (as we've established)
  
✅ All statements are consistent with **A being the culprit**, and only A must be lying (the rest may or may not be lying — in this case, C is also lying).

- If C were guilty:
  - C says, "A didn't do it" → lie ⇒ A did it
  - But we assumed C was guilty, not A → contradiction

❌ So **C cannot be the culprit**.

---

### ✅ Conclusion

After analyzing all possibilities and eliminating contradictions, the **only consistent scenario** is that:

- **A is the one who broke the window**
- A lied ("Not me!")
- B and C also lied (but this is allowed by the problem statement)
- D told the truth

This satisfies **all constraints** of the problem.
