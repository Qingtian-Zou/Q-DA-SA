# Thinking

We need to parse logic puzzle: four kids: A, B, C, D. One of them broke the window and that person is lying. Other kids may lie or tell truth arbitrarily (unknown). We know the perpetrator's statement is false. We have statements:

A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" So A says "I did not break." Equivalent to claim: A is innocent.
B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." B claims B is guilty (broke it).
C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" So C says "A didn't break."
D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear."

We assume each statement is either entirely true or false? Each child making a single statement. Might be multiple clauses but we can interpret logically.

Goal find who broke window. We know perpetrator lies. Others may lie too (so can't rely on them being truthful). But if we deduce contradictions that only one person fits as liar, that's the culprit.

Let’s denote G = true if child is guilty? Actually G_X indicates X broke window. So exactly one of A,B,C,D has G=true. The guilty's statement must be false (i.e., all its content false). However we have to interpret each child's statements: some are multiple parts; but as a whole, the entire statement might need to be considered? Usually in puzzles each "statement" is a single proposition. But here they say "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" This could be interpreted as "I did not break." That's the content: A is innocent. For B: "It was me. I broke it." Equivalent: "B broke it." So statement: B is guilty. For C: "He didn't do anything!" Means A didn't break. For D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear." Means not (B broken). So each child's statement can be represented as proposition:

A_statement: ¬G_A
B_statement: G_B
C_statement: ¬G_A
D_statement: ¬G_B

We know guilty's statement false. Others may be true or false. So we need a model where exactly one child is guilty, the guilty child's statement is false, and no contradictions.

Let's test each possible culprit.

Case 1: A guilty (G_A=true). Then A_statement "¬G_A" would be false because G_A= true => ¬G_A=false. So guilty statement false satisfied. B's statement G_B? Since only one guilty, G_B=false. So B_statement is false. C_statement ¬G_A: since G_A=true, ¬G_A=false => C_statement false. D_statement ¬G_B: since G_B=false -> ¬G_B = true => D_statement true.

So outcomes: A guilty, his statement false; B, C false; D true. Is this allowed? We have only one guilty; other kids may lie or tell truth arbitrarily. That matches: D could be telling truth. So consistent.

Case 2: B guilty (G_B=true). Then B_statement G_B = true => statement would be true. But guilty must lie, so inconsistent. Thus B cannot be guilty because he says he is guilty which would be true; but guilty's statement must be false. Unless we interpret "B told truth" as part of his statement? Wait B says: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." That might indicate that he asserts he's telling the truth. But maybe it's a meta-statement; but still he claims guilt. If guilty's statement must be false, then B cannot be guilty.

Case 3: C guilty (G_C=true). Then G_C is true but we don't have any statement about C. None of others mention C. So no contradictions. However, the guilty child's statement must be false. But C's own statement? He didn't say anything about himself; he said something else. Wait each child made only one statement. The puzzle says: "Here's what they had to say for themselves." Means each child gave a single utterance. We need to analyze which of those utterances is the guilty's statement, and it must be false. But C didn't talk about guilt or innocence; his statement refers to A. So if C were guilty, his statement could be true or false regardless: we don't know. But we have condition "you know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying." This implies that the guilty's statement is false. We need to check if in scenario where C is guilty, at least one of those statements (the guilty's) would be false? Wait we don't know which child's statement is from guilty. If C is guilty, his statement "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" is either true or false depending on whether G_A= true/false. In scenario where G_C=true and only one guilty, G_A=false. So statement "¬G_A" = true. That would mean the guilty's statement is true. But guilty must lie. So C cannot be guilty.

Case 4: D guilty (G_D=true). Then D_statement ¬G_B would evaluate to ¬G_B. Since only D is guilty, G_B=false => ¬G_B=true. Thus D's statement true, but guilty must lie. Inconsistent. So D can't be guilty either.

Thus the only possible guilty candidate that satisfies condition of liar: A. However we need also check consistency with other statements? The others may lie or truth; no contradictions. But let's double-check if there are any hidden logical contradictions among statements? Let's evaluate all statements under G_A=true scenario:

A_statement false; B_statement false; C_statement false; D_statement true.

So we have 3 false statements, 1 true. No conflict; each child's statement independent. That's acceptable: only condition that guilty lies is satisfied. So answer: A broke window. But confirm if puzzle might treat "lies" as entire content not just part? B said "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." If he told truth about himself being guilty, then his statement would be true, but he claims to be telling truth; that meta-ling? Wait, we may need to consider nuance: Suppose B says "I did it" and also claims to tell truth. If the person is lying about his guilt, the entire statement false; but maybe his claim of telling truth might make the statement contradictory? Let's analyze B's statement structure:

B says: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." That's basically two sentences: first "I will tell the truth" (a meta-statement). But it's part of his overall utterance; if he is lying, then at least one component is false; but we can't split? Usually puzzle treat each child's statement as a single proposition; multi-sentence still considered entire content. For B to be guilty liar, his whole utterance must be false: that would mean that the conjunction "I will tell the truth AND I broke it" is false, which means at least one clause false. But if he claims he will tell truth but actually lying about guilt, then 'will tell truth' might be considered false because he's not telling truth overall. So B's utterance could be false even though he states guilty? Wait we need to think carefully.

If B is the perpetrator, he says: "Ok, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." He is lying overall; thus his entire statement (the conjunction) must be false. That means not( (he will tell truth) AND (it was him)). For a conjunction to be false, at least one part false. If he actually lies about guilt, then the clause "It was me" is false. Then the overall statement may still be considered false regardless of "I will tell truth." So it's plausible B being guilty might be okay? But puzzle states "you know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying." That would mean B's statement is false; but we must also consider that B's claim to "tell truth" might be part of his lie. However, if B said he will tell truth yet he lies, then his whole utterance is contradictory but still could be considered as lying? Usually if you say "I will tell the truth" but you actually lie about something else, your overall statement includes that meta claim, which becomes false (since you don't tell truth). So the entire statement false. That would satisfy requirement.

But earlier we concluded B cannot be guilty because his statement is true. But maybe our interpretation too strict. Let's re-evaluate with proper semantics.

We need to interpret each child's utterance as a single proposition that could be compound but still considered true or false as a whole. For each child, evaluate truth value of entire utterance given the actual state (who broke). The guilty's entire utterance must be false; others may be anything.

Thus we need to parse B's utterance: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." This is basically a conjunction: "I'll tell the truth" AND ("It was me") AND ("I broke it"). But note 'It was me' and 'I broke it' are essentially same; but maybe duplication.

But if B is guilty, then "it was me" true; "I broke it" true. And he says he'll tell truth: is that also true? If he tells truth about his guilt, yes it's consistent. But we assume he's lying overall; but does the liar condition require him to lie on at least one clause? It's ambiguous. The puzzle may mean that the guilty child lies in his statement as a whole (i.e., the content is false). So if B says "I broke it" and he indeed did, then his entire statement would be true. That conflicts with rule. Therefore B can't be guilty. But we might still think maybe 'OK, I'll tell the truth' clause being false? But that depends on him lying about some part; but we just said he's guilty -> statement "I broke it" is true. The whole conjunction will then be true only if each component true. Since "I'll tell truth" would also be true (assuming he does), entire utterance true, violating requirement. So B cannot.

Thus earlier deduction stands: A must be guilty.

But let's double-check that other possibilities could still satisfy liar condition because some other child might have lying statement. Wait we need to find scenario where exactly one child's statement is false and the others may be any truth value? Not exactly; we know perpetrator's statement false, but we don't know if other children's statements can also be false or true. So we only require that guilty's statement is false. But it doesn't forbid other kids' statements being false. But they could also be false. That's fine.

Let's analyze each candidate again with truth values of all statements:

- A guilty: A_statement false; B_statement false; C_statement false; D_statement true. Works.

- B guilty: Evaluate under assumption G_B=true, others innocent. Statement: For A: ¬G_A (true). B's statement: "I'll tell the truth" AND ("It was me") AND ("I broke it"). Since G_B true, these subclauses all true. So entire conjunction true -> B_statement true. But guilty must lie. Inconsistent.

- C guilty: Evaluate. G_C=true; others innocent. Statements: A: ¬G_A (true). B: G_B (false). C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" which is ¬G_A = true. D: ¬G_B = true. But we need guilty's statement false: C_statement is true; fails.

- D guilty: G_D=true. Evaluate statements: A: ¬G_A (true). B: G_B (false). C: ¬G_A (true). D: ¬G_B (true). D_statement would be true because G_B false. But guilty's statement must be false. Fails.

Thus only A satisfies rule.

However we have to think about possibility that the guilty child might be B or other if his statement considered false due to 'I'll tell truth' being false? Wait: If B is guilty and says "I'll tell truth" but he's lying, then the phrase "I'll tell truth" would be false. But he also claims it's him; that's true. The conjunction of a false part with true parts results in overall false, which satisfies requirement! Let's examine: Suppose we treat "OK, I'll tell truth." as statement that may itself be false if he is not telling truth (i.e., lying). But he's claiming to be truthful but actually lies? That seems contradictory. But can we consider that "I'll tell truth" as a claim about his future statement; it's part of current utterance; but we can't evaluate it as independent after the fact.

If B's entire statement is false because he says he'll tell truth but does not (since he's lying), then entire conjunction false, even though some subclauses true. But that would mean he's indeed lying overall, which aligns with rule.

But puzzle likely expects each child's statement to be considered as a single proposition. In B's case the statement is "It was me. I broke it." The first clause might be just a preface; we consider "I broke it". So if guilty, it's true. But then liar condition violated. Unless we interpret B's entire sentence "I'll tell truth" indicates he's not telling truth about the rest? Eh.

Better to treat each utterance as proposition(s) that may contain multiple claims, but overall must be false if guilty. For B's statement: It's a combination of 'I'll tell truth' and 'I broke it.' If B is guilty, 'I broke it' is true; 'I'll tell truth' could be considered false because he lied about something else? But we can't evaluate the meta-level after the fact.

Simpler assumption: each child either tells truth or lies entirely. B says "It was me. I broke it." So if he is guilty, his statement truthful. That conflicts with rule. So B cannot. This reasoning yields answer A.

Let's also double-check puzzle text: "You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying." This strongly indicates liar status. Usually these puzzles assume each child makes a single statement which can be true or false; the guilty's statement must be false. So our deduction stands.

Thus answer: A broke the window.

But we should produce explanation elegantly.

Let's craft final solution:

Define G_X for X in {A,B,C,D}. Exactly one is true (guilty). Each child's utterance content yields propositional formula.

- A says ¬G_A
- B says G_B
- C says ¬G_A
- D says ¬G_B

The guilty's statement false. Evaluate possibilities. Only A's guilt leads to his statement false while the rest may be anything, with no contradictions. Others produce guilty statements true (or not false). Therefore A is culprit.

Also we can add explanation: If B, C or D were culprit their respective statements would be true; cannot happen because guilty must lie. Thus A broke window.

Let's craft final answer accordingly.

# Answer

Let  

* \(G_A , G_B , G_C , G_D\) mean “A (respectively B,C,D) broke the glass.”  
Only one of these is true, and the child who broke it *lies*.

---

### What each child says

| Child | Statement | Logical form |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **A** | “Not me! I didn’t break a thing!” | \(\neg G_A\) |
| **B** | “OK, I’ll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it.” | \(G_B\) |
| **C** | “Don’t be mad at A! He didn’t do anything!” | \(\neg G_A\) |
| **D** | “B didn’t break the glass, I swear.” | \(\neg G_B\) |

(Each child’s whole utterance is taken as a single proposition; if it is false the child is lying.)

---

### Test every possible culprit

1. **A guilty (\(G_A= T\))**  
   * A: \(\neg G_A = F\) – lying (as required).  
   * B: \(G_B = F\) – innocent, statement false.  
   * C: \(\neg G_A = F\) – innocent, statement false.  
   * D: \(\neg G_B = T\) – innocent, statement true.

   All conditions are satisfied; no contradiction.

2. **B guilty (\(G_B= T\))**  
   * B’s statement \(G_B = T\) is *true*.  
   But the guilty child must lie → impossible.

3. **C guilty** (the other three innocent):  
   * C’s statement \(\neg G_A = T\) (since A is innocent).  
   The guilty child would be telling the truth – not allowed.

4. **D guilty**:  
   * D’s statement \(\neg G_B = T\) (B innocent).  
   Again, a liar would be truthful – impossible.

Only when **A** is the culprit does the guilty child’s statement become false while the other children’s statements can be either true or false. Hence the only possible solution is:

> **The window was broken by A.**

So A is the scamp who threw the ball through your window.
