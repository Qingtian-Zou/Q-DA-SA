[Thinking]
We need to parse puzzle: four kids A,B,C,D. One of them threw a ball through window. The scamp who broke the window is lying. So the guilty person says false statement(s). The other children may lie or tell truth (unknown number). But we know exactly one child is guilty, and that child's statements are lies. However some innocents might also be lying; we cannot assume they all truthful.

Goal: figure out which child broke the window.

We have statements:

A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!"
B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it."
C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!"
D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear."

We need to interpret them as statements that may contain multiple claims. We need to evaluate possibilities consistent with exactly one guilty child whose statements are all lies (maybe partially). Actually "the scamp who broke your window is lying" means the guilty child's statement(s) are false. But does it mean each of their statements must be false? Usually in puzzles like this, if a liar says multiple sentences, each sentence may be true or false; but "the scamp who broke your window is lying" could mean that their overall claim (that they didn't break the glass) is false. But we might need to interpret each statement as a single proposition: e.g., A's statement: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" Actually that's two claims: "not me" and "didn't break a thing". They are logically equivalent? If you didn't do it, you didn't break. So it's one claim essentially that they did not break the window.

But B says: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." That is two claims: "It was me" and "I broke it". That's basically same content (they are telling the truth). But we can treat as single statement: He claims he is guilty.

C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" This states that A did nothing. So it's a claim about A's innocence.

D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear." Claim about B being innocent.

We need to find consistent assignment of truth values such that exactly one child is guilty and their statements are lies (i.e., false). But the other children may lie or tell truth arbitrarily. So we need at least one scenario where all conditions satisfied. And presumably only one possible culprit fits.

But we must be careful: The puzzle might involve subtle logic: e.g., if B says "It was me" and "I broke it", but he claims he's telling the truth, which could be a statement that he is being truthful? But maybe it's just his claim of guilt. In any case, B's statements are about him.

We need to consider each possible guilty candidate: A, B, C, or D.

But we also need to interpret "the scamp who broke your window is lying." This could mean that the guilty child's statement(s) are false. But it might not require all statements from that child be false? Usually if a liar says multiple statements, each can be true/false individually; but the phrase suggests that the guilty child is lying (i.e., they lie about something). We need to decide.

The puzzle states: "You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying. However, an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well." So we know the guilty child is lying; but others might lie or tell truth. That implies each child's statement can be considered individually: The guilty child will produce at least one false statement? Or all statements are false? The phrase "the scamp who broke your window is lying" might mean that that kid's entire statement is a lie (i.e., everything they said is false). But we can't be sure. However typical puzzles say: "The liar always lies." So if someone says multiple things, each is false. But some puzzles have liars may sometimes tell truth? Let's examine context.

Given the puzzle, it's probably like this: The guilty kid's statements are all lies; the others might lie or not. That means that for each statement by the guilty child, it must be false. For other children, their statements can be true or false.

Thus we need to find which child could produce a set of false statements while also being consistent with the statements from others.

Let's analyze systematically.

Let’s define variables:

G: The guilty child (A,B,C,D). We need to find which one is guilty.

For each child i, we have statement S_i. We'll treat them as propositions that might be true or false.

We need to ensure that S_G is false. For others, S_j can be either T or F; no restrictions.

But also the scenario must be logically consistent: If a child says "It was me", that implies guilt? But it's just a statement about reality. So if B says "It was me" and he is guilty, then his statement would be true (if we consider truth). But we require S_B to be false if B is guilty. That means either the content of B's statement must be false. But if B is guilty, "It was me" would be true; thus can't be false. So B cannot be guilty? Wait, but he might have said two claims: "It was me." and "I broke it." Both are true statements if he's guilty. So his statement would be true, violating the requirement that the guilty child's statement is a lie. Unless we interpret his claim as not being about guilt? But it is.

So maybe the puzzle's trick: The guilty child is lying, but B says he is telling truth (maybe false). Let's examine each scenario.

Let's parse each statement more formally:

A says: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!"

This is basically two identical claims. But we can treat as one claim that A did not break the window. So S_A: ¬G(A). Actually S_A asserts that A is innocent, i.e., G != A.

B says: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it."

This might be interpreted as B says: He will speak truthfully; then he claims he did break it. So we can treat his claim as two statements:

S_B1: B is telling the truth (this could refer to something else? But it's just a statement that he's truthful). That may not be relevant.
But maybe we should parse each child's statement as one proposition for simplicity: For A, "I didn't break it." For B, "It was me; I broke it" i.e., "B is guilty." For C, "He didn't do anything!" i.e., "A did nothing." For D, "B didn't break the glass."

But we need to decide if each child's statement includes multiple sub-statements that may be individually true or false. Let's analyze with each child as one proposition.

Simplify:

S_A: "I didn't break it" (or equivalently ¬G(A)). We'll treat S_A = ¬(G = A).

S_B: "It was me; I broke it." Equivalent to G = B. So S_B = (G = B). But note that B also says "OK, I'll tell the truth." Might be a separate statement but maybe we ignore.

S_C: "A didn't do anything!" Equivalent to ¬(G = A).

S_D: "B didn't break the glass" Equivalent to ¬(G = B).

So we have four statements:

S_A = ¬(G=A)
S_B = (G=B)
S_C = ¬(G=A)
S_D = ¬(G=B)
Now we need to find G such that S_G is false, and other statements may be true or false arbitrarily. But we might also need to ensure consistency: If multiple children claim the same thing but it's contradictory with the actual G, some statements will be false.

We can evaluate each candidate:

Case 1: G = A (A guilty). Then:

S_A = ¬(G=A) => S_A is ¬True => False. So A's statement is false. Good because we require the guilty child's statement to be false. So far consistent.

S_B = (G=B) => G=B? No, G=A, so false. B's statement false.

S_C = ¬(G=A) => false again (since G=A). So C's statement false.

S_D = ¬(G=B) => true (since G != B). D's statement true.

So we have: A's statement false (fits), others can be any truth values. This scenario works: The guilty child is A, and indeed his statement is false; B, C also lie but that's allowed; D tells truth. So scenario consistent.

Case 2: G = B

Then:

S_A = ¬(G=A) => true (since G=B). So A's statement true.

S_B = (G=B) => true. But B is guilty, his statement must be false (since guilty child lies). This fails because S_B is true. Unless we interpret "the scamp who broke your window is lying" meaning that the guilty child's statement(s) are false; but if B's statement is true then it's inconsistent. So G cannot be B.

Case 3: G = C

Then:

S_A = ¬(G=A) => true (since G=C). A tells truth.

S_B = (G=B) => false (since G≠B). B lies.

S_C = ¬(G=A) => true. But C is guilty, his statement must be false. S_C is true. So fails. So cannot be C.

Case 4: G = D

Then:

S_A = ¬(G=A) => true (since G=D). A tells truth.

S_B = (G=B) => false (since G≠B). B lies.

S_C = ¬(G=A) => true. C tells truth.

S_D = ¬(G=B) => true (since G≠B). D's statement is true, but D is guilty, so his statement must be false. So fails.

Thus only consistent scenario with the rule that guilty child's statements are all false is G = A. So A is guilty.

But we need to double-check: Did we misinterpret B's statement? Maybe we mis-simplified incorrectly. Let's examine more thoroughly.

Alternatively, maybe each child says multiple sentences; for example:

A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" That could be considered two separate claims: "I'm not the one who threw the ball" and "I did not break anything." But both refer to same event. So if A is guilty, his statement would be false (both are false). If he is innocent, his statements true.

B says: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it."

This might have 3 sentences:

"OK, I'll tell the truth." This could be considered a meta-statement about his honesty, but not directly related to guilt.

"It was me." (claiming he is guilty)

"I broke it." (again claim of guilt). But if B is guilty, both claims are true. So if we require all statements from the guilty child to be false, B cannot be guilty because his statements would be true. But maybe the puzzle expects that only one statement by each child counts? But the puzzle says "they had to say for themselves" meaning each child's entire utterance is considered; but it's ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps we interpret that a liar always lies, i.e., all of their statements are false. So B cannot be guilty because his claim that he broke it would be true if he indeed did break it. But maybe the puzzle intends that a liar might lie in some parts and tell truth in others? But then "the scamp who broke your window is lying" could mean they lie about something (like claiming innocence). So B's statement "It was me; I broke it." would be an admission of guilt, so if he is guilty, he's telling the truth. That contradicts the rule that guilty child lies.

Thus A must be guilty because only in that scenario his statements are false. But we need to double-check that for G = A, all other conditions hold: The innocent kids may lie or tell truth; it's allowed. So answer: A is guilty.

But let's test if there's any nuance: Could the puzzle have a twist where B's claim "OK, I'll tell the truth" might be false? If B is guilty, maybe he lies about telling truth; but his claims about guilt would still be true. But that would mean at least one of his statements (the meta-statement) is false, but the other two are true. So if we interpret the rule "scamp who broke your window is lying" as "the scamp's overall statement(s) contain lies" rather than all being lies, then B could still be guilty because he lies about telling truth? But that seems too contrived.

Let's parse the puzzle again: "Four kids were playing, and one of them threw a ball right through your window. Here's what they had to say for themselves." So each child gave statements. Then we have:

A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!"
B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it."
C: "Don't be mad at A! He did not do anything!"
D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear."

"You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying." So we know that the guilty child is lying (so their statements are false). However, an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well. Can you figure out which one of these darned kids broke your window?

We need to interpret "the scamp who broke your window is lying" as meaning that the guilty child's statement(s) are lies. But it's ambiguous whether each child can make multiple statements, but if a liar might lie in some or all of them? Usually liar means they always lie; but puzzle may not specify. But we can assume that any child can make multiple claims, and if they're guilty, they will lie about being guilty (i.e., claim innocence). So B's statement would be an admission of guilt: "It was me" etc. So B cannot be guilty because then his statements would be true.

But the puzzle might have a trick where we need to consider that A says "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" This is basically two identical claims. But maybe the puzzle intends that a liar might say one false statement among many; but each child's utterance may include multiple sentences, some may be true or false. But for guilty child, all of their statements must be false? Or at least they have to lie about being guilty? Let's think.

But let's analyze more thoroughly: Suppose we interpret the puzzle as each child can make multiple claims. The rule "the scamp who broke your window is lying" could mean that the guilty child is not telling the truth (i.e., their overall claim of innocence is false). But they might also make other statements that are true or false; but the puzzle says "an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well." So only we know for sure that the guilty child's statement(s) are lies. It doesn't say all of them must be false, just that the guilty child is lying (i.e., their claim about innocence is a lie). But they might also make other statements that could be true or false. However, we cannot assume they'd make any particular truthfulness for each part.

Let's consider each child's utterance as a set of claims:

A: Claim 1: "Not me!" Claim 2: "I didn't break a thing!"
But those are essentially same claim; but we can treat them as two separate claims. If A is guilty, both are false. So A's statement(s) contain lies (both). So it's consistent with being liar.

B: Claim 1: "OK, I'll tell the truth." Claim 2: "It was me." Claim 3: "I broke it."
If B is guilty, claim 2 and 3 are true. But claim 1 could be false if he is lying about telling truth. So B might have one lie (claim 1) and two truths. That would still mean that the guilty child is lying in at least one statement (claim 1). The puzzle says "the scamp who broke your window is lying." That could be satisfied by B because he lies about telling truth. But is it typical to interpret that way? Maybe.

But we might need to examine if any other child being guilty yields consistent assignments for all statements such that the guilty child's statements include at least one lie, and no contradictions with others' statements? Let's test each possibility:

Option 1: G = A

A's claims: Claim 1 "Not me!" is false; Claim 2 "I didn't break a thing!" also false. So both are lies. So guilty child is lying (fits). Good.
Now we need to see if other children may lie or tell truth arbitrarily but must be consistent with actual G = A. That means any statement that refers to guilt must reflect reality: e.g., B says "It was me" which is false; C says "A didn't do anything!" which is false; D says "B didn't break the glass" which is true.

We can evaluate each child's claims:

B's Claim 1: "OK, I'll tell the truth." This statement might be about his own honesty. But it's ambiguous if it should be considered relative to reality: Did he tell the truth? He said "It was me; I broke it." Since these are false, B didn't tell the truth overall. So claim 1 is false. So B has at least one lie (claim 1). That's allowed because we only know guilty child lies; others may lie or not.

Claim 2: "It was me." False.

Claim 3: "I broke it." False.

So all of B's statements are false. That is okay.

C's claims:

Claim 1: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" The part "He didn't do anything" refers to guilt. Since G = A, this claim is false. But the first clause "Don't be mad at A!" doesn't refer to truth value; it's a rhetorical phrase but could be considered true or false? Hard to evaluate. But likely we treat only the factual statement about guilt as relevant.
But maybe we should treat each child's utterance as one proposition: e.g., "A didn't do anything" etc. But for B, his claim is about his own guilt; for C and D, it's about others. So we can treat them as single statements.

Let's consider simpler interpretation: Each child makes a single statement (the entire phrase). We treat each child's entire utterance as one proposition that may be true or false based on actual guilt. But then the content of B's utterance is "It was me." That's basically his claim of guilt. So if he's guilty, his statement is true; if not, it's false. The meta-statement "OK, I'll tell the truth" can be considered part of the same proposition? That might change truth value.

But typical puzzle: Each child says a single statement, but they might phrase it in multiple sentences; we evaluate whether that statement as a whole is true or false. So for B, his entire utterance could be considered to mean "It was me." But he also says "OK, I'll tell the truth." That may not change truth value of the proposition "It was me" but might add nuance.

But let's think: The puzzle likely expects that each child's statement is a single proposition about who broke the window. So we can treat them as:

A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" => Equivalent to "A didn't break it." (Proposition: ¬(G=A))

B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." => Equivalent to "B did break it." (Proposition: G=B)

C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" => Equivalent to "A didn't break it." (Proposition: ¬(G=A))

D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear." => Equivalent to "B didn't break it." (Proposition: ¬(G=B))

Thus we have 4 propositions. We need to find G such that the guilty child's proposition is false; others may be any truth value.

We've done this earlier and found only G = A works. So answer: A.

But let's double-check if maybe B could also satisfy condition because his statement includes a lie about telling truth, but his claim "It was me" would be true. But the puzzle says guilty child is lying (not necessarily that all statements are lies). But we can't guarantee that B's statement as a whole is false: Because "OK, I'll tell the truth." might be false but "It was me. I broke it." might be true; but the entire utterance might be considered a single proposition: If it's ambiguous, maybe it's not wholly false. However typical logic puzzles treat each child's entire utterance as a single statement that can be evaluated as true or false; they don't consider sub-statements.

Thus we need to parse accordingly. Let's read the puzzle text carefully:

"Four kids were playing, and one of them threw a ball right through your window. Here's what they had to say for themselves.

A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!"
B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it."
C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!"
D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear."

You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying. However, an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well. Can you figure out which one of these darned kids broke your window?"

We need to parse each statement. Let's think about what the statements mean:

A says "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" So he claims innocence.

B says "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." He claims guilt and also says he's telling truth (maybe as meta). But his claim of guilt is contradictory with lying if he's guilty? But maybe he is lying about telling truth? Wait, we need to interpret.

C says "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" So he defends A, claiming innocence.

D says "B didn't break the glass, I swear." He claims B innocent.

So each child's statement is a claim about guilt of some child. We can treat them as single statements: For A and C, they both say A is innocent; for B, he says B is guilty; for D, he says B is innocent.

Thus we have:

S_A = "A didn't break the window."

S_B = "B broke the window." (or equivalently "It was me" and "I broke it". But that's same.)

S_C = "A didn't break the window." (like A)

S_D = "B didn't break the window."

Now we need to find G such that the guilty child's statement is false. That means if G = A, then S_A is false; good. If G = B, then S_B is false; but S_B would be true if G=B. So fails. If G=C, then S_C is false? Wait S_C states "A didn't break it." But C's statement doesn't mention C at all. So S_C refers to A. That would not involve C's guilt. So the guilty child's statement would not necessarily be about their own guilt; they might claim something else. But the rule says "the scamp who broke your window is lying". It doesn't say that the guilty child must lie about being guilty, just that the guilty child is lying (somehow). If C is guilty, his statement S_C refers to A's innocence, which could be true or false depending on reality. But if C is guilty and S_C states "A didn't break it" but G=C, then A didn't break it; so S_C would be true. That would contradict the requirement that guilty child's statement is a lie (false). So C cannot be guilty because his statement would be true.

Similarly D: If G=D, then S_D says "B didn't break it." But B didn't break it if G=D, so S_D would be true; violates requirement that guilty child lies. So D cannot be guilty.

Thus only A works as guilty child. This matches earlier analysis.

But we should confirm that the puzzle might have a twist: Maybe there is scenario where multiple children could be guilty but some statements are ambiguous? But no, exactly one broke window.

However, let's double-check if any scenario with G=A would produce contradictions for other children's statements being allowed to lie or truth. Since we only require guilty child's statement false; others can lie or not. So all assignments that satisfy that condition will work. Let's verify:

If G = A:

S_A: "A didn't break it." => False (fits requirement).
S_B: "B broke it." => False.
S_C: "A didn't break it." => False.
S_D: "B didn't break it." => True.
So we have B and C both lying, D telling truth. That is allowed because only guilty child's statement must be false; others may lie or not. So scenario consistent.

Thus answer: A.

But the puzzle might want reasoning: The guilty child says something that is false. Let's think about each child's statements relative to actual guilt:

If B were guilty, his statement "It was me" would be true; so he wouldn't be lying (contradiction). So B cannot be guilty.

If C or D were guilty, their statements don't involve themselves; they'd claim innocence of someone else. That could be either true or false. But if they are guilty, they'd have to lie about something. But their statement might still be false? Let's check: For C as guilty, S_C says "A didn't do anything." If G=C, then A didn't break it (true). So S_C would be true. That contradicts requirement that guilty child's statement is a lie. So C cannot be guilty.

Similarly for D: S_D says "B didn't break the glass." If G=D, B didn't break it; thus statement true. Contradiction. So D cannot be guilty.

Thus only A fits. But we need to consider nuance of B's meta-statement about telling truth; but if we treat his statement as single proposition that includes all parts, maybe it's considered false because the "OK, I'll tell the truth" part is a lie? Let's analyze: Suppose G=B. Then B says: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." The entire utterance might be considered one statement comprising three sentences; but to evaluate if it's true or false, we need to decide what constitutes truth of multi-sentence utterances. Usually in logic puzzles, each child's statement is a single proposition, not a set of independent claims. But here they are multiple sentences.

But maybe the puzzle expects us to consider that B's entire utterance includes two contradictory statements: "It was me" and "I broke it." But those are consistent if he is guilty; but if he's lying, one of them must be false. But B says "OK, I'll tell the truth" which could be a lie; but the rest may be true. So his overall statement might not be wholly false.

But puzzle states: "the scamp who broke your window is lying." That implies that the guilty child lies about something (maybe not necessarily about their guilt). But we only know for sure that they are lying. Others may or may not lie. So if B says "It was me" and he indeed did break it, then his statement would be true. He might still be lying in another part: "OK, I'll tell the truth." That could be false (he's lying about telling truth). But is that considered a lie? The puzzle may treat each child's entire utterance as one statement; if any part of it is false, we can consider the whole statement false? Or maybe they treat each child as making multiple statements and we evaluate them individually. But typical logic puzzles require evaluating each statement's truth value separately. So each child might have multiple independent claims. The rule that guilty child lies might apply to each claim: all of them are false. But then B would not be guilty because his claim "It was me" would be true if he is guilty.

Let's examine the phrase "the scamp who broke your window is lying." It could mean that this child's statements are all lies, i.e., everything they say is false. Because typically in such puzzles, liars always lie; so each statement by a liar is false. The puzzle also says "However, an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well." That indicates that each child might have multiple statements and some of them might be lies; but we don't know how many.

But if the guilty child is lying (all his statements are false), then B cannot be guilty because he would have to lie about "It was me" which would be false; but that would contradict him being guilty. So B cannot be guilty. Similarly for C and D: If they were guilty, they'd have to lie about other claims, e.g., C's statement "He didn't do anything" would need to be false if G=C? Wait, if G=C, C's statement is about A not doing it; that would be true (A didn't break it). So that would be a truth. But the guilty child must have all lies; so can't.

Thus only A fits.

But we should also consider scenario where each child might say multiple statements but we evaluate them individually: The rule says "the scamp who broke your window is lying." That could mean at least one of his statements is false, not necessarily all. But then B could still be guilty because he could lie about telling truth and claim guilt; but if we consider each statement separately, B would have a false statement (claim about telling truth) but also two true statements. The puzzle might treat the liar as lying in general, not necessarily all statements. But it's ambiguous.

Let's examine the original wording: "You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying." That implies we know that the guilty child is lying. It doesn't specify how many lies or whether they are telling truth about something else. Usually if you say someone is lying, you mean their statement(s) are false.

But if B says "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." We might interpret as B's entire statement: He claims he will be truthful and then asserts his guilt. But if he's guilty, his claim of guilt would be true; so he's not lying about that. However, maybe we consider that his first part "OK, I'll tell the truth" is a lie, but that doesn't make his whole utterance false? In logic puzzles, usually each statement must be considered as a single proposition or each sentence separately.

But to avoid confusion, let's treat each child as making one statement: A says "I didn't break it." B says "It was me." C says "A didn't do anything." D says "B didn't break the glass."

Thus we have four statements. The guilty child's statement is false; others can be true or false.

Now we need to find which child could be guilty such that his statement is false.

We already found only A works. But we must double-check for B: If G=B, then S_B would be true, violating requirement. So B cannot be guilty.

If G=C, S_C says "A didn't do anything." Since G=C, A didn't break it; so S_C true -> contradicts requirement. So C can't be guilty.

If G=D, S_D says "B didn't break the glass." Since G=D, B didn't break it; so S_D true -> contradictory.

Thus only A works.

But is there any possibility that we misinterpret statements? For example, maybe D's statement "B didn't break the glass" could also refer to B not breaking window (i.e., B didn't break the window). But if G=D, then B indeed did not break it. So S_D would be true, violating requirement.

Thus only A works.

But we should also consider possibility that the guilty child might have made multiple statements and all of them are false; but we don't need to evaluate each statement separately because we treat each child's entire utterance as a single statement. But still only A fits.

Now let's produce answer: The kid who broke your window is A.

But maybe there's trick: Suppose the guilty child said "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" That could be considered two statements: first one denies guilt, second one says he didn't break anything. If guilty child lies, then at least one of those must be false. But if he's guilty, both are false anyway. So that works.

But we need to show reasoning: The only child who claims innocence but is the liar (makes a false claim). The others either claim guilt or defend someone else. The guilty child must lie about something; B's statement includes an admission of guilt which would be true if he were guilty, so cannot be liar. C and D's statements don't involve themselves; they could be lies if we consider them but they are not necessarily false. But the only candidate whose statement definitely is false if they are guilty is A.

Thus answer: A.

But to ensure no hidden trick, let's analyze all possibilities thoroughly:

We have 4 children: A,B,C,D.

Statements:

A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" Equivalent to "A did not break it."

B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." Equivalent to "B did break it" (plus meta about telling truth).

C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" Equivalent to "A did not break it."

D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear." Equivalent to "B did not break it."

We know that exactly one child broke window. And we know guilty child is lying (i.e., his statement false). Others may lie or tell truth.

Thus we need to find G such that S_G is false. Let's check each:

If G = A: S_A false. Works. S_B, S_C false; S_D true. Fine.

If G = B: S_B true. Contradiction. So can't.

If G = C: S_C false? Wait S_C states "A didn't break it." But if G=C, A didn't break it -> S_C true. So cannot.

If G = D: S_D false? S_D says "B didn't break the glass." If G=D, B didn't break it -> S_D true. Contradiction. So can't.

Thus only G=A.

But we must consider possibility that maybe "the scamp who broke your window is lying" might refer to them telling lies about something else; but we can still rule out others because if they were guilty, they'd have at least one statement that could be considered false (maybe the meta part). But we cannot guarantee. However, we found only A works.

Thus answer: The kid who broke your window is A.

Now we need to produce explanation in final message: show reasoning step by step.

But before writing final answer, let's double-check if any nuance might change result:

Suppose B's statement "OK, I'll tell the truth" could be considered a lie. If B were guilty, his meta-statement would be false, but the rest of his statements would be true. So he would have at least one lie (the meta). That satisfies "the scamp who broke your window is lying." But we might interpret that the liar's entire statement must be false; but if we treat each sentence separately, B could be guilty because he lies about telling truth.
But then C and D statements: If G=B, S_C says "A didn't do anything!" That's true. So C would be truthful. S_D says "B didn't break glass." That is false (since B did). So D would be lying. So scenario with G=B yields:

A's statement: "I didn't break it" => true.

B's statements: meta part false, claims guilty true. So B lies at least in meta part; he might be considered liar.

C truthful.

D lies.

This scenario is consistent with only guilty child's statement being a lie? Wait, B had both true and false statements; but the rule says "the scamp who broke your window is lying." That could mean that all of their statements are lies. But we don't know if that's the case. The puzzle states "However, an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well." So they didn't say that only guilty child is liar; they said we know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying. That means at least one of their statements is false? Or all?

In typical puzzles, if you say "the liar" it's usually everyone else might tell truth or lie but liar always lies. But here they didn't use word "liar", just "scamp who broke your window is lying." So we interpret as that child's statement(s) are false. That implies at least one statement by them is false; could be all.

Thus scenario with G=B seems possible because B's meta-statement is false, making him a liar about telling truth. But does that satisfy "the scamp who broke your window is lying"? Yes: He lies (about his honesty). So we cannot rule out B based on this interpretation. We need to analyze more carefully.

Let's read the puzzle again:

"You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying. However, an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well."

This means: Among all kids, we know that the guilty child is lying (maybe at least one lie). But others could also be lying or telling truth.

We cannot assume each child's statement is a single proposition; they might say multiple statements. So we need to consider which kid's entire set of statements includes lies. That may include partial truths and falsehoods.

But if B is guilty, his statement "OK, I'll tell the truth" would be false because he's lying about telling truth. But he also says "It was me. I broke it." Those are true. So he has at least one lie (the meta). Thus he qualifies as a liar. But we need to ensure that no other child also lies? Actually others may also lie, that's allowed. So scenario with G=B is consistent.

But then what about A's statement: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" If B is guilty, both of those are true (A is innocent). So A tells truth. Good.

C says "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" That is also true. D says "B didn't break the glass, I swear." That statement would be false because B did break it. So D lies.

Thus scenario with G=B yields:

A: truthful
B: liar (meta false)
C: truthful
D: liar
This scenario fits the condition that guilty child is lying and others may lie or tell truth. So we cannot rule out B based solely on this interpretation.

But then we must consider if any other candidate also satisfies? Let's test G=C:

If G = C, what are statements?

A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" This would be true (A innocent). Good.

B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." If G=C, B's statement is false (both claims about guilt are false; he also says he'll tell truth which is false because he's lying? Wait if he's not guilty, his meta could be true or false depending on whether he's actually telling truth. But we don't know. Let's evaluate each part:

"OK, I'll tell the truth." This is a claim that B will be truthful. If B's entire statement is false (he lies about guilt), then he is lying in at least one part; but his meta might be true if his claim that he'll tell truth is not necessarily consistent with him being guilty? Wait, we need to consider B's whole statement: "OK, I'll tell the truth." That is a claim about himself. If B says this, it's ambiguous whether he will indeed tell truth or not. But in scenario G=C, B is innocent and his statement includes claims that are false (that he broke it). So at least part of his statement is false. Thus B might be lying.
But the puzzle states we know for sure that guilty child is lying. It doesn't say innocents can't lie; they can. So it's okay if B lies even though he's innocent. But we need to ensure that guilty child's statement is false. For G=C, what about C's statements? They are: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" If G=C, then A indeed did not break it. So this statement would be true. So C tells truth. That contradicts requirement that guilty child lies. So G=C cannot be because the guilty child's statement is true.

But maybe we could interpret "scamp who broke your window is lying" as meaning they lie about something else, like they are lying in some part of their statements but not necessarily all. In scenario G=C, C's statement would be true (so he is not a liar). So fails.

Similarly for G=D: D's statement "B didn't break the glass" would be true; so guilty child's statement would be true -> not allowed.

Thus only possible guilty child that makes his/her statements false is A. But we found scenario with B also works if we interpret lying as at least one lie. But C and D cannot because their statements are true if they were guilty. So we need to determine which interpretation of "the scamp who broke your window is lying" the puzzle expects.

Let's examine original puzzle wording: "You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying." That suggests that the guilty child is not telling truth; i.e., he lies about something. Usually in puzzles, if someone is lying, all of their statements are false. But maybe it's ambiguous.

But we can test whether B could be liar: He says "OK, I'll tell the truth." If he's lying about telling truth, his statement about telling truth is false. So he's lying at least partially. The puzzle states that the guilty child is lying; it doesn't say he told only lies or all lies. But if we interpret "lying" as "not telling the truth," then B's claim to tell truth is a lie, so he's lying. That fits.

But what about A's statements? If G=B, both of A's claims are true (A innocent). So A tells truth. That's allowed because others may be lying or telling truth.

C: also tells truth. D lies. So we have 1 liar guilty and 1 other liar D. This is consistent with "an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well." So scenario G=B works.

Now let's test if any other candidate could also satisfy that condition. Let's analyze each:

Case G = A: All statements by A are false (he denies guilt). That satisfies requirement. Others may lie or truth. Good.

Case G = B: At least one of B's statements is false (the meta part). So guilty child lies. Others can lie or truth. Works.

Case G = C: C's statement would be true; so guilty child doesn't lie. Not allowed.

Case G = D: D's statement would be true; not allowed.

Thus we have two possible guilty candidates: A or B.

But maybe we need to consider the meta statement of B "OK, I'll tell the truth." This is a claim about his honesty. But if he says that, does it actually count as part of his overall statements? It might be considered an assertion that he's telling truth, but it's not a factual statement about who broke window. In logic puzzles, we typically evaluate each proposition relative to reality: "I will tell the truth." This is a self-referential statement. But if B says "OK, I'll tell the truth," and then he says "It was me. I broke it," that might be considered as two separate statements; but maybe they are part of same utterance but we treat each sentence separately.

But the puzzle states: "Here's what they had to say for themselves." It lists each child's statement with quotes. The sentences inside may be multiple. So each child has a set of claims.

We need to find which child is guilty given that the guilty child is lying (maybe all their statements are lies). But the puzzle says "an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well." This implies we cannot rely on others telling truth; they might lie too. So we must consider each child's entire set of claims. The only requirement: For the guilty child, all of his/her statements must be false? Or at least one false? The phrase "the scamp who broke your window is lying" seems to indicate that the guilty child lies. That could mean all their statements are lies.

Let's examine typical puzzle phrasing: If we say "the liar is lying," we usually mean the liar's statements are false. But if we just say "the person is lying," we might mean at least one statement is false. But it's ambiguous.

But in logic puzzles, they usually specify "The guilty party always lies" or "All liars lie." Here they didn't explicitly say that; they said "you know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying." That could be interpreted as "the guilty child is lying about something." But we don't know if other statements might also be true.

But maybe the puzzle expects you to treat each child's statement as a single proposition. Then B's statement is "It was me." So if he were guilty, his statement would be true, which conflicts with requirement that guilty child lies. So B cannot be guilty. That leads to A only. But we need to check if there is any other candidate if we treat each child's entire utterance as one proposition? Let's examine.

We can parse:

A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" Equivalent to "A didn't break it."

B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." This could be considered "It was me" (the actual claim). The meta part may not count.

But if we treat B's entire utterance as one proposition, it's ambiguous because includes multiple claims. But we might condense to "B did break it". If B were guilty, that statement would be true, violating requirement.

Thus only A qualifies.

However, the puzzle likely expects this reasoning: The guilty child lies; so whichever child's statement is false must be guilty. We can test each child's claim:

A says "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" That means he denies guilt. If his statement were true, he'd be innocent; but if it's false, he's guilty.

B says "It was me. I broke it." So if his statement is true, he might be guilty. But the puzzle says the guilty child lies. So B cannot be guilty because then his statement would be true (he's saying he did it). Thus B is innocent.

C says "He didn't do anything!" He defends A; but if that statement were false, that means A did break it; so C would be lying about A being innocent. But the guilty child must lie. If A broke it, then A's statement is false (he denies guilt). So A could be guilty.

D says "B didn't break the glass." If his statement is true, B didn't break it. If it's false, B did break it. If B did break it, that would contradict earlier conclusion that B cannot be guilty because his statement would be true if he were guilty. But maybe we need to evaluate again.

Let's analyze using each child's single proposition approach:

Let P_A = "A didn't break the window."

Let P_B = "B broke the window." (Because he says "It was me" and "I broke it.")

Let P_C = "A didn't do anything!" Equivalent to "A didn't break it."

Let P_D = "B didn't break the glass."

Now we need to find G such that the guilty child's proposition is false.

Let's test each:

If G=A, then P_A is false. Good.

If G=B, P_B would be true (since B broke). So not allowed.

If G=C, P_C says "A didn't break it." Since A didn't break it if G=C, that statement is true. Not allowed.

If G=D, P_D says "B didn't break the glass." Since B didn't break it if G=D, it's true. Not allowed.

Thus only G=A works.

But we need to double-check whether any scenario with G=B could produce a false proposition for B: For example, maybe B's statement is considered as multiple sentences and the liar might be lying about telling truth but still claiming guilt; but that would mean his overall claim includes at least one true part. But if we treat each sentence separately, B has at least one lie (meta). So he qualifies as liar. But then we need to check whether any other child could also be guilty? No.

But the puzzle's wording "You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying." Usually in logic puzzles, if you say someone is lying, it means all of their statements are false. Because otherwise they'd say "the liar" or "someone lies". But it's ambiguous.

Let's search memory: Many puzzles with similar phrasing like "You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying." They expect you to interpret that the guilty child says something that is false. But they don't specify if all statements are false. However, typical logic puzzles require us to deduce which one did it given each child's statements and that exactly one of them lies about being guilty? Wait.

Maybe we should analyze the puzzle more thoroughly by enumerating all possibilities for truth assignments to each statement while satisfying constraints: Exactly one child broke window; guilty child's statements are false (maybe all false); other children's statements may be true or false. Determine which child could be guilty consistent with that.

We did that earlier and found only A works. So answer is A.

But we must also consider scenario where guilty child's statement might have multiple sentences: some of them might be true, but the overall claim about guilt might still be false? But if we treat each sentence as separate proposition, then B would have at least one lie (meta), but his claim "It was me" is true. So B's statements are not all lies; but he does lie in one part. But do we consider that guilty child lying? Yes, because he did lie. But the puzzle says "the scamp who broke your window is lying." That could mean at least one of his statements is false. So B qualifies.

But then we need to find which child fits all conditions: The guilty child's statement(s) must include a lie; others may also have lies. So both A and B qualify? Wait, but we need to check if for G=A, do any other children also have lies? We found that B and C are lying (both statements false). That's allowed.

But for G=B, D is lying. Also A and C telling truth. That scenario works too.

So both A and B would satisfy the given constraints under this interpretation. So puzzle wouldn't be solvable uniquely. But maybe there is an additional constraint: The guilty child must lie about their guilt (i.e., they deny it). In that case, only A qualifies because B's statement acknowledges guilt. That might be the intended reading: "the scamp who broke your window is lying" meaning the guilty child denies it. So we look for a child whose denial of guilt is false.

Thus answer: A.

Let's examine each child's statements:

A says "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" This is a denial. If he's guilty, this statement is false. So his lie would be about guilt.

B says "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." He confesses. That would be true if he were guilty. But we know guilty child lies; so can't be B.

C says "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" This is a defense for A. If A did break it, this statement is false. So the liar could be C? Wait, but C's statement would then be false if G=A (since A did break it). But we already found G=A works because A's statements false; but C also lying. But that's allowed.

But maybe we can rule out B by reasoning: If B were guilty and lies about telling truth, he would still admit guilt later. That might not fit the phrase "the scamp who broke your window is lying." The liar might lie in some part of his statement? But typical puzzles treat liars as always lying (no truth). So B cannot be.

Thus answer: A.

But let's double-check if there could be scenario where G=C or D that also yields guilty child's statements false. Let's analyze each more thoroughly, but we already found they produce true statements for guilty child; so not allowed.

So final answer: A.

Now we need to craft final explanation:

Summarize each statement: A denies guilt, B confesses, C defends A, D denies B's involvement.

Only one kid broke window. We know the guilty child lies.

Evaluate each child's denial/claim: If G=A, then A's statements are false; B and C also lie but that's allowed; D tells truth. So scenario consistent.

If G=B, B's confession would be true (contradiction). Similarly if G=C or D, their statements would be true. So only A works.

But we need to show that the guilty child is lying about his own guilt: Because A denies it but he's guilty, so his statement is false. Others may lie; it's okay.

Thus answer: The culprit is A.

However, maybe puzzle expects you to consider also that B says "OK, I'll tell the truth." That could be a liar because he later confesses; but if we interpret the entire utterance as one proposition (i.e., he will tell truth) then his statement is false. But then his confession may not count? Eh.

But I'm comfortable with answer: A.

Let's craft final message:

Explanation: The guilty child must make a false statement about who broke the window.

Evaluate each child's claim.

If we assume that only the guilty child lies, then B cannot be guilty because he confesses; if C or D were guilty their statements would be true (they defend others). So only A fits.

Alternatively, show via truth table: For each possible culprit, evaluate truth values of all statements and see which scenario satisfies that the guilty child's statement is false. Only G=A works.

Thus answer: A.

Now produce final answer accordingly.

[Answer]
The culprit is A

1. Translate every child’s words into a single proposition
Child	What he says (in one sentence)	    Proposition
A	“Not me! I didn’t break a thing!”	    PA/PA: “A did not break the window.”
B	“It was me. I broke it.”	            PB/PB: “B broke the window.”
C	“He didn’t do anything!” (defending A)	PC/PC: “A did not break the window.”
D	“B didn’t break the glass.”             PD/PD: “B did not break the window.”
(Each child’s whole utterance is treated as one statement about who broke the window.)

2. The rule we know
Exactly one of the children actually broke the window.
The guilty child is a liar – his (single) statement must be false.
The other children may lie or tell the truth; no restriction.
So, for each possible culprit we check whether that child’s statement would be false while the others can be either true or false.

3. Check every possibility
Assumed culprit PA/PA   PB/PB   PC/PC   PD/PD   Guilty child’s statement?
A	            false	false	false	true	false – satisfies the rule
B	            true	true	false	false	true – violates the rule (a liar cannot tell truth)
C	            true	false	true	false	true – violates the rule
D	            true	false	false	true	true – violates the rule
Only when A is the culprit does his statement become false; all other children’s statements can be either true or false, which is allowed.

4. Conclusion
The only way to satisfy the puzzle’s conditions—exactly one child broke the window and that child’s statement is a lie—is for A to be the scamp who threw the ball through your window.

Answer: A.
