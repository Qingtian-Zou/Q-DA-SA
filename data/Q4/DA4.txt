[Thinking]
Okay, let's try to figure out who broke the window. So there are four kids: A, B, C, D. One of them is the culprit, and they're lying. The others might be lying too, but we know the scamp (the guilty one) is lying. Wait, actually, the problem says: "You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying. However, an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well." Hmm, so only the guilty one is definitely lying? Or does it mean that the guilty one is lying, and others could be lying or telling the truth? Wait, the problem says: "the scamp who broke your window is lying." So the guilty one is lying. But others might be lying too. So we need to see who is lying, knowing that exactly one person is lying (the guilty one), but wait, no. Wait, the problem says: "an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well." So the guilty one is lying, but there could be more liars among the others.

Wait, but the problem states: "the scamp who broke your window is lying." So that's a fact. So the guilty one is a liar. The others could be either truth-tellers or liars. But we have to figure out who the guilty one is.

Let me list out their statements:

A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" So A is claiming he's innocent.

B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." So B is saying he did it.

C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" So C is saying A is innocent.

D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear." So D is saying B is innocent.

We need to find who is lying (the guilty one), and possibly others.

Let's consider each possibility.

Case 1: Suppose A is guilty.

If A is guilty, then A is lying (which matches the fact that the guilty one is lying). Now, what about others?

B says "It was me." So if A is guilty, then B is lying. So B would be a liar.

C says "A didn't do it." But A did it, so C is lying.

D says "B didn't break it." Since A did it, B didn't, so D is telling the truth.

So in this case, guilty is A. Then liars are A, B, C. But the problem states that the scamp (guilty) is lying, but others may be lying too. So this is possible? Wait, but the problem says "an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well." So multiple liars are possible.

But let's check if this holds. Wait, but we need to see if there's a unique solution.

Case 2: Suppose B is guilty.

Then B is lying (since he said "It was me" but he's guilty, so he's lying). Wait, no: Wait, if B is guilty, then his statement "It was me" would be a lie? Wait, no. Wait, if someone says "It was me" and they are guilty, then they are telling the truth. Wait, hold on. Wait, this is critical.

Wait, in logic puzzles like this, usually, if someone is lying, their statement is false. So if the guilty person is lying, then their statement is false.

So for example, if B is guilty, then his statement "It was me" would be a lie. Wait, but that would mean that "It was me" is false, so it wasn't him. But he's the guilty one. Wait, this seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Let me think again.

The problem says: "the scamp who broke your window is lying." So the guilty one is a liar. So the guilty person's statement is false.

So if someone is guilty, their statement is false.

So let's re-express each person's statement in terms of truth.

A says: "I didn't break a thing." So if A is guilty, then his statement is a lie (so he did break it), which fits. If A is innocent, then his statement is true.

B says: "It was me." So if B is guilty, then his statement is true. But the guilty one is supposed to be lying. Wait, this is a key point.

Wait, hold on. Wait, if B is guilty, then according to the problem, the guilty one is lying. But B says "It was me." If he's guilty, then he's telling the truth. But the problem says the guilty one is lying. Therefore, B cannot be guilty. Because if he were guilty, he would be telling the truth, which contradicts the fact that the guilty one is lying.

Ah! That's a crucial point. So this might eliminate B.

Wait, so let's parse this.

The guilty person is lying. So whoever broke the window is lying. So their statement must be false.

So for each person:

If X is guilty, then X's statement is false.

So let's go through each.

Case: A is guilty.

A's statement: "I didn't break a thing." False. So that's good, because he did break it. So A is lying. Correct.

B says: "It was me." Since A is guilty, this is false. So B is lying.

C says: "A didn't do it." Which is false, so C is lying.

D says: "B didn't break it." Which is true, since A did it. So D is truthful.

So in this case, guilty is A, and liars are A, B, C. But the problem states that "the scamp who broke your window is lying" (so only A is the scamp, but others may be lying). So this is possible.

Case: B is guilty.

B's statement: "It was me." If B is guilty, then his statement would be true. But the guilty person must be lying. Therefore, B cannot be guilty. So B is out.

Case: C is guilty.

C's statement: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" So C is saying A is innocent. If C is guilty, then his statement is a lie, so A did do it. But wait, that would mean that A is guilty. But we're assuming C is guilty here. Contradiction. Wait, no.

Wait, if C is guilty, then his statement "A didn't do it" is a lie. Therefore, A did do it. But if C is guilty, then A didn't do it (since C is the guilty one). Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, let's be precise.

If C is guilty, then C's statement "A didn't do it" is false. Therefore, A did do it. But that would mean that A is guilty, not C. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, C cannot be guilty. Because if C were guilty, then his lie would imply A is guilty. So C can't be guilty.

Wait, that's interesting. So C being guilty leads to a contradiction. Let me check.

Assume C is guilty.

Then C's statement "A didn't do it" is a lie. Therefore, A did do it. So A is guilty. But we assumed C is guilty. Contradiction. Therefore, C cannot be guilty.

So C is innocent.

Case: D is guilty.

D's statement: "B didn't break the glass." If D is guilty, then his statement is a lie, so B did break the glass. So B is guilty. But we assumed D is guilty. Contradiction. Wait, no.

Wait, if D is guilty, then his statement "B didn't break it" is false, so B did break it. So B is guilty. But we assumed D is guilty. So this would mean both D and B are guilty? But the problem states "one of them threw a ball right through your window." So only one guilty person. Therefore, contradiction. So D cannot be guilty.

Wait, this is a key point.

So if D is guilty, then his lie would mean B is guilty. But since only one person is guilty, this is impossible. Therefore, D cannot be guilty.

So from the above:

B cannot be guilty (because his statement would be true, but guilty must be lying)

C cannot be guilty (because his lie would imply A is guilty)

D cannot be guilty (because his lie would imply B is guilty)

Therefore, the only remaining possibility is A.

Wait, but let's check again.

Wait, in the case of A being guilty:

A lies (good)

B says "It was me" which is a lie (so B is lying)

C says "A didn't do it" which is a lie (so C is lying)

D says "B didn't break it" which is true (so D is truthful)

So in this case, only A is guilty, but B and C are also lying. But the problem says "the scamp who broke your window is lying. However, an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well." So it's possible that multiple people are lying, but the guilty one is definitely lying.

But according to our analysis, only A is possible.

Wait, but let's confirm again.

Wait, when we considered C being guilty, we had a contradiction, so C is innocent.

Similarly, D being guilty leads to B being guilty, which is a contradiction.

B can't be guilty because he would be telling the truth.

So only A is left.

But wait, another angle.

Wait, the problem says "the scamp who broke your window is lying." So the guilty one is a liar. So the guilty person's statement is false.

Let me tabulate:

If A is guilty:

A's statement: "I didn't break it." False. Good.

B's statement: "It was me." False (since A did it). So B is lying.

C's statement: "A didn't do it." False. So C is lying.

D's statement: "B didn't break it." True.

So guilty is A, with three liars (A, B, C). But problem allows others to be lying.

If B is guilty:

B's statement "It was me" would be true, but guilty must be lying. So impossible.

C guilty:

C's statement "A didn't do it" is a lie, so A did do it. So A is guilty. Contradiction.

D guilty:

D's statement "B didn't break it" is a lie, so B did break it. So B is guilty. Contradiction.

Therefore, only possible guilty is A.

Wait, but wait. Let me check once more.

Wait, another thought. Suppose the guilty person is lying, but others might be lying too. So the problem is not that only the guilty one is lying, but that the guilty one is lying (and possibly others too). So in the case of A being guilty, we have three liars. But according to the problem's statement, that's acceptable.

But according to our analysis, that's the only possibility.

But wait, I've heard similar puzzles where the answer is different. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's think again.

Wait, in the problem statement: "the scamp who broke your window is lying." So only the guilty one is lying? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: "You know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying. However, an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well."

Ah, so the scamp (the guilty one) is lying, but others may or may not be lying. So it's possible that more than one person is lying. So our previous analysis holds.

But according to the analysis, only A is possible.

Wait, but let's think: If A is guilty, then B and C are also lying. But is there another possibility?

Wait, wait a second. Wait, in the problem statement, it says "one of them threw a ball right through your window." So only one guilty person.

But according to the above, only A works.

But I have a doubt because sometimes in these puzzles, the answer is different. Let me check again.

Alternative approach: Let's assume each person is guilty and see if it holds.

Assume A is guilty:

A lies (good)

B says "It was me." False, so B lies.

C says "A didn't do it." False, so C lies.

D says "B didn't break it." True.

So this works: guilty is A, with B and C lying.

Assume B is guilty:

B's statement "It was me" would be true, but guilty must lie. So invalid.

Assume C is guilty:

C's statement "A didn't do it" is a lie, so A did it. But we assumed C is guilty, so contradiction. Invalid.

Assume D is guilty:

D's statement "B didn't break it" is a lie, so B did break it. But only one guilty person, so B is guilty too. Contradiction. Invalid.

So only A is possible.

Wait, but the problem says "the scamp who broke your window is lying". So the answer should be A.

But I have a feeling that maybe the answer is B. Wait, no, because if B were guilty, he would be telling the truth, which contradicts.

Wait, unless... Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says "the scamp who broke your window is lying". So the guilty one is a liar. So their statement is false.

But B says "It was me." If B is lying, then "It was me" is false, so it wasn't B. So if B is lying, then B is innocent. Wait, but we need to find the guilty one.

Wait, here's another angle. Let's consider who could be lying.

The guilty person is lying, so their statement is false.

Let's list the statements:

A: I didn't do it. (If A is guilty, this is a lie; else, true)

B: I did it. (If B is guilty, this is true; else, false)

C: A didn't do it. (If A is guilty, this is a lie; else, true)

D: B didn't do it. (If B is guilty, this is a lie; else, true)

We need exactly one person is guilty (the liar), but wait no: The guilty person is lying, but others may also be lying.

Wait, the problem says "the scamp who broke your window is lying. However, an unknown number of the other children may be lying as well." So only the scamp (guilty) is definitely lying; others could be lying or truthful.

Wait, but in logic puzzles like this, usually, the key is that exactly one person is lying (the guilty one), but here it's specified that the guilty one is lying, others may be lying too. So multiple liars possible.

But according to our previous analysis, only A works.

Wait, but let's think: If A is innocent, then his statement is true.

If A is innocent, then C's statement "A didn't do it" would be true.

If C is truthful, then A is innocent.

B says "I did it." If B is truthful, then B is guilty. But then B would be telling the truth, which contradicts the fact that the guilty one is lying. So if B is truthful, he's guilty, but he's supposed to be lying. So B cannot be truthful.

Wait, this is another way.

Suppose that the guilty person is lying. Let's see.

If B is lying, then "It was me" is false, so B is innocent.

If D is lying, then "B didn't break it" is false, so B did break it.

So if D is lying, then B is guilty.

But the guilty person must be lying. So if B is guilty, then B's statement "It was me" would be true, which contradicts. So D cannot be lying? Wait:

Wait, if D is lying, then B is guilty. But if B is guilty, then B's statement is true, which can't be. Therefore, D cannot be lying. Therefore, D is telling the truth.

Ah! This is a good point.

Let's see:

If D is lying, then B is guilty. But if B is guilty, then B's statement "It was me" is true, which contradicts the fact that guilty person lies. Therefore, D cannot be lying. Therefore, D is truthful.

So D is truthful: "B didn't break the glass."

Therefore, B is innocent.

So B is innocent.

Now, B is innocent, so his statement "It was me" is a lie. Therefore, B is lying.

Wait, so B is lying. So we have at least two liars: guilty person (who is lying) and B.

Wait, but we know guilty person is lying. So B is a liar as well.

Given that D is truthful (so B is innocent), so B is lying.

Now, since B is lying, and D is truthful.

Now, A says "I didn't do it." If A is guilty, then A is lying; else, truthful.

C says "A didn't do it." If A is guilty, then C is lying; else, truthful.

We know B is innocent (from D's truthful statement).

So the guilty person is either A, C, or D.

Wait, no: D is truthful, so D is not guilty (since guilty is lying). Wait, no: Wait, D is truthful, so D is innocent. Because if D were guilty, he would be lying, but we just concluded D is truthful. So D is innocent.

So guilty is among A, B, C. But B is innocent (from D's truth), so guilty is A or C.

Wait, let's recap:

From above:

D is truthful (because if D were lying, B would be guilty, leading to contradiction), so D tells truth: B is innocent.
Therefore, B is innocent, so B's statement "It was me" is a lie. So B is a liar.

So we have at least two liars: guilty person and B.

But the guilty person is lying, so that's the minimum.

Now, since B is innocent, guilty is A or C.

Case 1: A is guilty.

Then A's statement "I didn't do it" is a lie. Good.

C's statement "A didn't do it" is a lie. So C is lying.

So liars: A, B, C. D is truthful.

This works.

Case 2: C is guilty.

C's statement "A didn't do it" is a lie, so A did do it. But we assumed C is guilty, so A is innocent. Contradiction. Therefore, C cannot be guilty.

Therefore, only A is guilty.

Yes, this seems to confirm it.

So the answer is A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes these puzzles have a twist. Let me check once more.

Given that D must be truthful (as shown above), so B is innocent.

B is lying.

If A is guilty:

A lies

C lies

B lies

D truthful

This fits.

If C is guilty: leads to contradiction as above.

So yes, A must be guilty.

Therefore, the answer is A.

But wait, the problem says "the scamp who broke your window is lying". So A is the scamp.

But I recall a similar puzzle where the answer was different. Wait, let me think.

Wait, another angle: If D is truthful (B is innocent), and B is lying.

If A is innocent, then his statement is true.

C says "A didn't do it", which would be true.

So if A and C are truthful, then the guilty one must be... but we already know B and D are innocent (D is truthful, B is innocent). Wait, no, if A and C are truthful, then the guilty one has to be... but all others are innocent? No, there must be a guilty one.

Wait, hold on. Wait, in this approach:

We have D truthful => B innocent.

B is lying.

If A is innocent, then A's statement is true.

C's statement "A didn't do it" would be true.

So both A and C are truthful.

Then the guilty person must be... but we have four kids: A, B, C, D. B and D are innocent (B is innocent, D is truthful), A and C are truthful. So no one guilty? Contradiction.

Ah! Here's the key.

Wait, this is important.

If we assume that A is innocent (so truthful), then C is truthful (since A is innocent). Then both A and C are truthful. B is lying (so innocent). D is truthful (so innocent). So all are innocent? But the problem states that one of them broke the window. Contradiction.

Therefore, our previous conclusion that A is innocent leads to a contradiction, so A must be guilty.

Yes! That's the key.

Let's formalize this.

We have:

From D's statement: If D is truthful, then B is innocent. If D is lying, then B is guilty (but that leads to contradiction as before), so D must be truthful. Therefore, B is innocent.

Therefore, B is lying.

Now, if A is innocent:

A tells truth: "I didn't do it."

C tells truth: "A didn't do it."

So both A and C are truthful.

B is lying (innocent), D is truthful (innocent). So everyone is innocent except... wait, no one is guilty. But the problem states that one of them did it. Contradiction.

Therefore, A cannot be innocent. Therefore, A must be guilty.

Yes! That's the clincher.

So the logic is:

D must be truthful (as established), so B is innocent.

If A were innocent, then A and C would both be truthful, leading to no guilty person, which is impossible.

Therefore, A is guilty.

So answer is A.

I think this makes sense.

Final Answer
\boxed{A}

[Answer]
To determine who broke the window, we analyze the statements made by each of the four children: A, B, C, and D. The key constraint is that the scamp who broke the window is lying, but an unknown number of the others may also be lying.

Step 1: Understand the Statements
A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!"

→ A claims they are innocent.

B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it."

→ B claims they are guilty.

C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!"

→ C claims A is innocent.

D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear."

→ D claims B is innocent.

Step 2: Analyze Logical Implications
We are told that the guilty person is lying, but others may also be lying. So, only the guilty person is definitively a liar — the rest may be truth-tellers or liars.

Let’s examine each possibility for the guilty person and see which one is consistent with the rules.

Case 1: Assume A is guilty
A says: "I didn't break a thing." → False (A is guilty) ✅
B says: "It was me." → False (A is guilty) → B is lying ❌
C says: "A didn't do it." → False (A is guilty) → C is lying ❌
D says: "B didn't break it." → True (B is innocent) ✅
This case is logically consistent:

A is guilty (and lying)
B and C are also lying
D is telling the truth
This fits the rule that the guilty person is lying, and others may also be lying.

Case 2: Assume B is guilty
B says: "It was me." → True (B is guilty) ❌
But the problem states that the guilty person is lying. So B cannot be guilty, because that would mean B is telling the truth.
Conclusion: B is not guilty.

Case 3: Assume C is guilty
C says: "A didn't do it." → False (C is guilty) ✅
But if C is lying, then A did do it.
So A is also guilty → Contradiction (only one person is guilty)
Conclusion: C is not guilty.

Case 4: Assume D is guilty
D says: "B didn't break it." → False (D is guilty) ✅
So B did break it.
But then B is guilty → Contradiction (only one person is guilty)
Conclusion: D is not guilty.

Step 3: Critical Insight — Eliminating the Innocent Possibility
Let’s consider a key logical deduction:

If D is truthful, then B is innocent.
If B is innocent, then B's statement "It was me" is false → so B is lying.
If A is innocent, then A's statement "I didn't break a thing" is true.
If A is innocent, then C's statement "A didn't do it" is also true.
So in this scenario, A and C are both truthful, and B is lying, D is truthful → no one is guilty.
But the problem explicitly states that one of them broke the window. So this scenario is impossible.

Therefore, A cannot be innocent → A must be guilty.

Final Conclusion
Only Case 1 (A is guilty) is logically consistent with all constraints:

A is guilty and lying ✅
B and C are also lying ❌ (allowed by the problem)
D is truthful ✅
No contradictions with the rule that the guilty person is lying ✅
All other cases lead to contradictions or contradictions with the problem's premise that exactly one person broke the window.

✅ Final Answer
A
