[Thinking]
We have four statements:

A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" So A claims innocence and that they didn't break anything.

B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." B says it's true that he did it. He claims honesty.

C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" C claims A is innocent.

D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear."

We know for a fact that the scamp who broke your window is lying. So the guilty one lies in their statement. The other kids may or may not lie. We need to deduce which kid broke it.

Let’s denote the truthfulness of each statement as T (true) or F (false). Let G be the actual breaker. Then if someone is G, their statement must be false. Others can be anything.

We have statements:

A says: "I didn't break a thing." That statement is true iff A is not G. So statement truth = (A != G).

B says: "It was me. I broke it." Statement truth = (B == G). Actually, B says it's the truth that he did it. So if his statement is true, then B == G; if false, then B != G.

C says: "He didn't do anything!" meaning A didn't break. That statement truth = (A != G).

D says: "B didn't break the glass." Statement truth = (B != G).

We know that the guilty kid's statement is false. So for G, their statement truth must be false. For others, no constraint.

We need to find a consistent assignment of G and truth values such that exactly one of the statements corresponding to G is false. Wait: The guilty's statement is false; but other kids may also lie (i.e., have false statements). So we just need at least the guilty's statement false. Others could be either true or false.

But if more than one statement is false, it's okay unless that implies a contradiction? There's no restriction on others lying. So essentially we just need to find a G such that the statement of G is false (i.e., inconsistent with actual event). And there should exist truth assignments for other statements consistent? But other kids' statements must be evaluated based on G; they are either true or false automatically given G, no choice.

Thus we examine each possible G and see if their own statement would be false. Let's compute:

Case 1: A is guilty (A==G). Then evaluate statements:

A's statement "I didn't break a thing" is false because A did break. So okay, guilty's statement false.

B's statement "It was me" is false because B != G. That's fine.

C says "A didn't do anything" which is false because A did. Fine.

D says "B didn't break the glass" which is true because B not guilty. So we have three false statements (A, B, C) and one true (D). Is that allowed? Yes, unknown number of other children may lie as well. There's no restriction against multiple lies.

Thus A could be guilty. Check consistency: No contradictions? All statements evaluated given G=A. That's fine.

Case 2: B is guilty. Then:

A's statement "I didn't break" would be true because A not guilty. So A says truth.

B's statement "It was me" would be true because B guilty. But the guilty must lie. So B's statement cannot be true; but we have it as true, which violates rule that guilty lies. Thus B cannot be guilty. Because B's statement would be true if he is guilty, violating requirement.

Wait: Actually if B is guilty, his statement "It was me" is indeed true. But the problem says the scamp who broke your window is lying. So guilty must lie. Therefore B cannot be guilty.

Case 3: C is guilty. Evaluate:

A's statement "I didn't break" would be true because A not guilty.

B's statement "It was me" false because B != G.

C's statement: "A didn't do anything." Since C is guilty, A didn't break; so that statement is true (C says A innocent). But C is guilty and must lie. So C's statement would be true => invalid. Thus C cannot be guilty.

Case 4: D is guilty. Evaluate:

A's statement "I didn't break" true because A not guilty.

B's statement false because B != G.

C's statement true (A innocent). Good.

D's statement "B didn't break the glass." Since D is guilty, B not guilty, so that statement is true. But D must lie, but it's true => invalid. So D cannot be guilty.

Thus only possible guilty is A. So answer: A broke the window.

Double-check: B says it was me; if B were guilty, his statement would be true, violating rule. Yes.

Therefore solution: A.

We can provide explanation.

Answer – A was the one who broke your window

Why this works
Let’s translate each child’s words into a logical condition that depends on who actually broke the glass.

Child	Statement	                                Truth value if X is guilty
A       “I didn’t break it.”	                    true iff A≠XA=X
B	    “It was me. I broke it.”	                true iff B=XB=X
C   	“Don’t be mad at A! He didn’t do anything!” true iff A≠XA=X
D	    “B didn’t break the glass, I swear.”	    true iff B≠XB=X
We know the guilty child must lie – his statement has to be false.

The other children may or may not lie; we’re only told that they can.

Now test each possible culprit:

Suppose guilty =	A	                                    B	                                                    C	                                                    D
A’s statement	    false (he did it) – OK, he must lie.	true (not guilty) – would be truthful → impossible.	    true (not guilty) – would be truthful → impossible.	    true (not guilty) – would be truthful → impossible.
B’s statement	    false (not guilty) – fine.              true (he did it) – but guilty must lie → impossible.    false (not guilty) – fine.                              false (not guilty) – fine.
C’s statement	    false (A actually did it) – fine.	    true (A innocent) – fine.	                            true (A innocent) – but guilty must lie → impossible.	true (A innocent) – fine.
D’s statement	    true (B innocent) – fine.	            true (B innocent) – fine.	                            true (B innocent) – fine.                               true (B innocent) – but guilty must lie → impossible.
Only when A is the culprit does his own statement come out false (as required), while no other child’s claim forces a contradiction. All other children can have either truth or lies; there is no rule that they must tell the truth.

Hence the only consistent possibility is:

A broke the window
