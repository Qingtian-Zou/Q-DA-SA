We need find consistent assignment where exactly one liar among them? Actually we know the culprit is lying. Others may lie too. So we just need to identify who broke window such that their statement contradicts truth. We don't know others' truthfulness. But maybe only one scenario works.

Let's denote statements:

A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" -> claims not culprit and didn't break? Actually same. Means A is innocent.

B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it." B claims he is culprit.

C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!" C says A did nothing => A innocent.

D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear." D says B not culprit.

We need exactly one liar? No, we know the culprit is lying. Others may lie too; no restriction on others. So only requirement: The statement of culprit must be false. Others could be true or false arbitrarily.

We must find which child can be culprit such that their statement is false, and the statements of others are not contradictory with possibility. Let's test each:

If A is culprit: A says "Not me! I didn't break a thing!" That would be false (since he did). Good. B says it's him; true? B says it was me, which would be true if A culprit. So B's statement true. C says A didn't do anything -> false. D says B didn't break glass -> true. This is consistent: Culprit lying, others can lie or truth. Works.

If B is culprit: B says he did; that would be true (since he is culprit). But culprit must lie => not possible. So B cannot be culprit.

If C is culprit: C says A didn't do anything. If C culprit, statement could be true if A innocent. That's fine. Culprit lying requirement: C's statement must be false. So we need C's statement false -> means A did something (i.e., broke). But that would mean A also culprit? Only one culprit. Contradiction. So C cannot be culprit.

If D is culprit: D says B didn't break glass. If D culprit, his statement must be false => B did break glass. That would make B also culprit, impossible. So D can't.

Thus only possible culprit is A. Answer: A broke window.

[Answer]
A was the one who broke it.

Why?

The rule: The child who actually broke the window must be lying in his statement.
The other children may lie or tell the truth – there’s no restriction on them.
Kid	Statement	What it says if the kid is the culprit
A	“Not me! I didn’t break a thing!”	If A broke the window, this statement is false (he did). ✔️
B	“It was me. I broke it.”	If A were the culprit, B’s claim that he did it would be true. No conflict – B can tell the truth.
C	“A didn’t do anything!”	With A as culprit, this is false (A did). C may lie.
D	“B didn’t break the glass.”	If A is culprit, B didn’t break it, so D’s statement is true. D can tell the truth.
All other possibilities break the rule that the culprit must be lying:

If B were the culprit, his statement would be true – impossible.
If C were the culprit, his claim that A did nothing would have to be false, meaning A also broke it, contradicting a single culprit.
If D were the culprit, his denial of B would have to be false, so B would have broken it as well – again two culprits.
Thus only A satisfies the condition that the culprit’s statement is a lie while allowing any truth‑value for the others. So A broke your window.
