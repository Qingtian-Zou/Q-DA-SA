Okay, let's see. So there are four people: A, B, C, and D living in a 9-story building. Each is on a different floor, and we need to figure out which floor each one is on based on their statements.

Starting with person A: "I live three floors below D." That means if D is on floor X, then A is on floor X-3. So the difference between D's floor and A's floor is 3. Since it's a 9-story building, possible floors for D would have to be at least 4th floor because if D was on 1st, A would be below ground level, which isn't possible. Similarly, D can't be higher than 9th floor; otherwise, A would be above. So D's possible floors are from 4 to 9, and correspondingly A's floors would be 1 to 6.

Person B says: "I live on either the 7th or 8th floor." So B is definitely on 7 or 8. That narrows it down a bit for both of them.

Person C claims: "I live on an odd-numbered floor." The building has floors 1 through 9, so possible odd floors are 1,3,5,7,9. Since all four people are on different floors, each person must be unique in their floor number.

Person D states: "The floors where the four of us live are evenly spaced apart." Evenly spaced implies that the difference between consecutive people's floors is the same. So if we order them from lowest to highest, each subsequent person is a certain number of floors higher than the previous one. For example, if they were spaced by 1 floor each, they'd be on consecutive numbers. But since there are four people and nine floors, the spacing could vary.

Let me try to approach this step by step. First, let's consider D's statement about even spacing. If the floors are evenly spaced, then the number of intervals between them would be one less than the number of people. Since there are four people, that means three gaps. So if we denote the first floor as F1 and the last as Fn, the difference (Fn - F1) must be divisible by 3. For example, if they were spaced every two floors apart, then the total span would be 6 floors (since 3 intervals * 2 floors each). The possible spans could be 6, 9, etc., but since it's a 9-story building, the maximum possible difference is 8 (from floor 1 to 9), so possible common differences are 1 (consecutive), 2 (every other floor), 3 (every three floors), or maybe even larger intervals if allowed by spacing.

But given that there are four people with evenly spaced floors, let's list all possible arithmetic sequences of four terms within 1-9. The starting term and the common difference must satisfy:

Start + 3*diff ≤ 9

So for diff=1: start can be from 1 to 6 (since 6+3*1=9)
For diff=2: start can be 1,2,3,4 (since 1+3*2=7; next would be 9 which is okay? Wait, wait. Let's check:

If diff=2, the sequence would be start, start+2, start+4, start+6. So if start is 1: 1,3,5,7
start=2: 2,4,6,8
start=3:3,5,7,9
start=4:4,6,8,10 → but 10 is invalid, so max start for diff=2 is 3.

Similarly, diff=3:
Start + 3*3 ≤9 → Start ≤3. So sequences like 1,4,7,10 (invalid), so only possible if start+9? Wait no. Let's compute:

Wait, starting at 1 with diff=3: 1,4,7,10 → invalid.
Starting at 2: 2,5,8,11 → invalid.
So actually, there's no valid sequence with diff=3 because the fourth term would exceed 9.

Diff=4:
Start + 12 ≤9? No. So impossible.

Therefore, possible evenly spaced sequences are those with difference 1 or 2. Let's list them:

Difference 1 (consecutive floors):
1,2,3,4
2,3,4,5
3,4,5,6
4,5,6,7
5,6,7,8
6,7,8,9

Difference 2 (every other floor):
1,3,5,7
2,4,6,8
3,5,7,9

So these are the possible arithmetic sequences for four people with even spacing. Now, let's see which of these can fit with B's claim that they live on 7th or 8th floors.

Looking at difference 1 sequences:
- 5,6,7,8: Here, D would be on 8 if it's part of this sequence (since the last term is 8). But A says "three below D", so if D is on 8, then A would be on 5. Then B could be on 7 or 8. Wait, but in this case, the four floors are 5,6,7,8. So all those people (A:5, next person 6, another 7, and D=8). But C has to be on an odd floor. In this sequence, we have 5,7 as odd; 6 is even, 8 is even. Wait, but there are two odd floors here: 5 and 7. So if the four people include both A (5) and someone else (maybe another person in the sequence). But B must be on 7 or 8. If D is on 8, then maybe B is on 7 or 8. Let's see:

In this case, floors are 5,6,7,8. Assigning people: A=5, someone=6, B could be 7 or 8, and C has to be on an odd floor (either 5 or 7). But if A is already on 5, then C would have to be on 7. Then the remaining person (D) is on 8. So that works: A=5, B=7, D=8. Wait, but in this sequence, there's also a floor 6 which hasn't been assigned yet. But we only have four people, so maybe:

Wait, no—if it's an arithmetic sequence with difference 1 starting at 5: floors are 5,6,7,8. So each person is on one of these floors, but they need to be spaced evenly by 1 floor. However, the problem states that D says "the four of us live are evenly spaced apart." So all four people (A, B, C, D) must occupy floors in an arithmetic sequence with common difference d.

Wait a second—if that's the case, then their entire set forms such a sequence. Therefore, if we can find which of these sequences includes A and D separated by 3 floors (as per A's statement), that might be key.

Let me check each possible evenly spaced sequence to see if they include both conditions: one person three below another (A and D) and B on 7 or 8.

First, let's look at the difference=2 sequences:

1,3,5,7
2,4,6,8
3,5,7,9

In each of these, check if there's a pair where one is three floors above another. For example, in sequence 1,3,5,7: D would be on the highest floor here (7), so A would need to be on 4 (since 7-3=4), but 4 isn't in this sequence. So that's out.

Sequence 2,4,6,8: Here, if D is on 8, then A should be on 5. But 5 isn't in the sequence. Wait, no—this sequence doesn't include 5. Alternatively, maybe another position? If D is on 6, then A would need to be on 3 (6-3=3). Then check if that's possible: In this case, the floors are 2,4,6,8. So if C has to be on an odd floor—here there's no odd floors except maybe none? Because all in sequence here are even numbers. Wait, the sequence is 2,4,6,8—all even. But person C must be on an odd floor. That contradicts because there are no odd floors in this sequence. Therefore, D can't live on 8 if they require four evenly spaced floors with none being odd except for possibly someone else's position. Wait, but all the people (A,B,C,D) would have to occupy these floors? Because "the four of us" implies that A, B, C, D are the only ones in the sequence.

Wait, no—D's statement is about their own group: "The floors where the four of us live are evenly spaced apart." So among themselves (A,B,C,D), their floors form an arithmetic progression. Therefore, all four must be on consecutive terms of one such arithmetic sequence. But each person's floor could also have other people living there not in this problem's scenario—no, wait—the apartment building has these four people plus others? Wait, the problem says "Four people... live on different floors..." So it's only those four: A,B,C,D are all distinct and occupy unique floors among 1-9. The rest of the apartments can be empty or occupied by others not part of this puzzle.

Therefore, D's statement is that their own floors (A,B,C,D) form an evenly spaced sequence—so regardless of where other people live in the building, these four have floors equally spaced. So for example, if they are on 2,4,6,8, that's a difference of 2 each.

So returning to sequences:

Difference=1: possible starting points from 1-6 as listed before.

Difference=2: sequences like 1,3,5,7; 2,4,6,8; 3,5,7,9.

Now, let's check if any of these sequences can satisfy A's statement that A is three below D (i.e., their floors differ by 3). Also, B must be on 7 or 8, and C on an odd floor.

Let me consider each possible evenly spaced sequence:

1. Difference=2: Sequence 1,3,5,7
   - Here, the four people would occupy these floors.
   - A needs to be three below D. Let's see: Possible pairs in this sequence where difference is 3:
     - From 1 to 4 (but 4 isn't there)
     - 3 to 6 (not present)
     - 5 to 8 (not present). So no pair with a difference of 3 here.
   - Therefore, invalid.

2. Difference=2: Sequence 2,4,6,8
   - Floors are 2,4,6,8. All even.
   - C must be on an odd floor—none exist in this sequence. So impossible because there is no person living on an odd-numbered floor here if all four were to occupy these floors. But wait—the problem says that the four people live on different floors. However, D's statement only refers to their own group's spacing; other people's (if any) might be elsewhere. Wait, but C must live on an odd floor regardless of where others are. So even if this sequence is considered for A,B,D, then someone else has to occupy the remaining person (C) who needs an odd floor not in 2,4,6,8. But since all four people have floors in that arithmetic progression, which doesn't include any odds except maybe none. Therefore, C cannot be placed here because there's no room for a fifth term if needed? Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the sequence must consist of exactly A,B,C,D's floors forming an evenly spaced set. So all four are on those floors in arithmetic progression. If that includes any odd-numbered floor(s), then C can be there. But if the entire group's floors are even (like 2,4,6,8), but there's no one living on odds except maybe not part of this group. Wait, no—the problem states "Four people... live on different floors." So all four have their own unique floor numbers among 1-9, each distinct. C's statement is that they themselves are on an odd floor; it doesn't say anything about others necessarily being there or not. But if the group's sequence (A,B,C,D) includes some odds and evens as per the arithmetic progression.

But in this case, for example, take difference=2: 1,3,5,7—this has four floors with a common difference of 2, all odd except maybe none? Wait no: 1 is odd, 3 odd, etc.—all odds. But C's floor must be on an odd number; so if the group includes these fours, then A,B,C,D are all on odd floors. However, B says they live on either 7th or 8th—if this group's sequence was say 1,3,5,7, but in that case, B would have to be on one of those odds. But the problem states B is on 7 or 8 (even). So conflict here.

Alternatively, maybe another arithmetic progression where some are odd and even? Wait, no—arithmetic sequences with difference 2 will alternate between even/odd depending on starting point. For example:

Start at 1: 1,3,5,7—all odds.
Start at 2: 2,4,6,8—all evens.
Start at 3: 3,5,7,9—odds and the next would be 11 which is invalid.

So only sequences with difference=2 starting on odd numbers are all odds. Starting even gives all evens. But B must be on an even floor (7 or 8), so if they were in a sequence of all evens like 2,4,6,8, then someone would have to be on 7th or 8th. Wait, but 7 and 8 are not both in the 2,4,6,8 sequence. So B can't be on those floors if they were part of that group.

Therefore, perhaps a different approach. Let's consider D's statement again: their four floors form an arithmetic progression. Also, A is three below D (difference of 3 between them), and C must be odd. B is either 7 or 8.

Let me think about possible pairs where A is three below D. So if D is on floor X, then A is on X-3. Possible combinations:

D=4 → A=1
D=5 → A=2
D=6 → A=3
D=7 → A=4
D=8 → A=5
D=9 → A=6

Now, considering that B must be on 7 or 8. So if D is on 7, then A would be on 4. Then the floors occupied so far are 4 (A), 7 (D). If someone else (C) is on an odd floor and B is on 7 or 8.

But let's check possible arithmetic sequences that include these pairs:

Case 1: D=7, A=4. So two people at 4 and 7. Now, we need a fourth person C on an odd floor, not conflicting with this. The remaining floors would be... Let's see the sequence needs to have four evenly spaced floors including 4 and 7.

What's the possible arithmetic progression that includes 4 and 7? The difference between them is 3 (7-4=3). Since there are two people here, they need three gaps in total. So if D is on 7 and A on 4, then perhaps this isn't part of a longer sequence because we only have four people: the progression would be from floor X to Y with step d such that one term is 4 (A) and another is 7 (D). Let's see:

Suppose the arithmetic sequence has terms: a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d.

If two of these are 4 and 7. So possible scenarios:

Either:
a + kd = 4
a + ld =7

with k and l integers between 0 and 3 (since four terms). The difference between the positions would be |k - l| must divide into the total span.

For example, if they are two apart in the sequence: say a+ d*1=4, a+d*2=7. Then:

a +d =4
a +2d=7

Subtracting gives d=3. Then a=4-3=1. So the sequence would be 1,4,7,10. But 10 is invalid. So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, if they are three apart in positions: like a+0*d=4 and a+3*d=7. Then:

a =4

4 +3d =7 → 3d=3 → d=1. So sequence would be 4,5,6,7. Here D is on 7 (third term), A is on 4 (first term). The spacing between them is 3 floors, which matches A's statement. Then the four people are at 4,5,6,7. Now check if this fits other conditions.

In this sequence:

- B must be on 7 or 8. But in this case, D is already on 7. So maybe C has to be on an odd floor: which would be either 1st term (4) but even, second term (5), third (6), fourth (7). Wait, the floors are 4,5,6,7. Among these, only 5 and7 are odd. But in this sequence, C must live on an odd floor, so possible positions for C: either fifth or seventh. However, B is supposed to be on 7th or 8th. If D is already on 7, then if someone else (B) also needs to be on 7 or 8—conflict because floors are unique.

Wait, this sequence has four people at 4,5,6,7. But B must be on either 7 or 8. So in this case, the only way is for B to be on 7th floor, but D is already there. Therefore, impossible. Hence this scenario doesn't work.

Another possibility: If A and D are not at the extremes of their sequence. Let's say they have three intervals between them with total difference of 3 floors (A to D is X-3). So if in a four-term arithmetic progression, two terms differ by 3, then what's possible?

For example, take the sequence starting at x with common difference d:

Term1: x
Term2: x+d
Term3: x+2d
Term4: x+3d

Suppose Term2 and Term5? No, only four terms. Wait, in a four-term progression, any two terms have differences that are multiples of the common difference times their positions apart.

Wait, maybe if A is on term1 (x) and D is on term2 (x+d). Then x+d - x =d=3 → d=3. So sequence would be x, x+3, x+6, x+9. But x+9 must be ≤9. Therefore, x can only be 0, which isn't valid. So impossible.

Alternatively, if A is on term1 (x) and D is on term4 (x+3d). Then their difference is 3d=3 → d=1. So sequence would have a common difference of 1: like starting at x, then x+1, x+2, x+3. But in this case, A=x and D=x+3. Which fits the condition that A is three below D (x vs x+3). Then B must be on 7 or 8. So if such a sequence includes 7 or 8.

Possible sequences with d=1:

Start at x where x+3 ≤9 → x≤6.

So possible starts: 1-6.

Let's check each starting point:

Start=1: Floors 1,2,3,4
Does this include 7 or 8? No. So B can't be here.

Start=2: Floors 2,3,4,5
Nope.

Start=3: Floors 3,4,5,6 → no

Start=4: Floors4,5,6,7 → includes 7. Here D would be on 7 (term4), A on4 (term1). Then B must be on7 or8. But D is already on7, so impossible.

Start=5: Floors5,6,7,8 → this sequence has floors up to8. So here:

A is on5 (term1), next person 6, then7, then8. If D is on8 (term4), A on5 satisfies the "three below". Then B must be on7 or8. But in this case, term3 is7 and term4 is8. Assigning people:

A=5, someone=6, C needs to be odd: possible floors are 5 or7. But A is already on5. So C would have to be on7. Then B must be on7 or8. If C is on7, then D could be on8 (which fits). Wait:

A=5, next person at6, third person at7 (C), fourth person at8 (D). But that gives a common difference of1 between each consecutive floor: 5-6-7-8? No—the differences are all 1. So this is an arithmetic sequence with d=1. Then D's statement holds.

But in this case, B would have to be on either7 or8. However, C is assigned to7 and D to8. But the problem states that four different people: A,B,C,D each live on separate floors. So if we assign:

A=5

Next person (term2)=6

C=7

D=8

But then B hasn't been placed yet. Wait, but there are only four people: A,B,C,D. Each must occupy one floor in the sequence. The arithmetic progression for them would be 5,6,7,8 with d=1.

In this case:

A is on5 (term1)

B could be term2=6

C needs to be odd—floor7 (term3) which is okay.

D is on term4=8.

But B says they are on7 or8. But in this scenario, B would have to be on6, which contradicts their statement. Therefore, invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence isn't starting at5 but another number where D can be on a higher floor and A three below.

Wait, let's try start=4: floors4,5,6,7

A is on4 (term1), next person5, then6, then7 (D). But B needs to be on7 or8. Here D is on7, so if C is assigned to another odd floor—floor5 in this case? Wait:

Floors:4 (A),5,6,7 (D). Then the four people are A,B,C,D at 4,5,6,7.

C must be on an odd floor. The possible odds here are5 and7. But D is already on7, so C could be on5. B needs to be on7 or8. So if we assign:

A=4

B=5 (but then C would have to be on another odd floor, but only 5 and7 left. If C is on7, which is taken by D—nope. Wait, this doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe B is on the next available even or whatever. But no, B must be on7 or8. In this sequence (4,5,6,7), there's no 8. So if we have to include someone at8, then perhaps another arithmetic progression where one of the terms is8.

Looking back at sequences with difference1:

Start=6: floors6,7,8,9

Here A would be on6, next person7, then8, then9. Then D is on9 (term4), A is on6 (term1). The distance between them is3 floors, which fits.

Now check the conditions:

B must be on7 or8. In this sequence: term2=7, term3=8, term4=9. So possible assignments:

A=6

Someone at7 (could be B)

C needs to be odd: in these floors, 7 and9 are odds. But D is already on9. So C could be on7 or another? Wait, the four people here would occupy6,7,8,9.

If we assign:

A=6

B must be at7 or8. Let's say B=7 (term2)

C needs to be odd: 9 is taken by D. Next available odd floor in this sequence is none—since only 6,7,8,9 are here. So C would have to be on another term not in the arithmetic progression? Wait no—the four people must occupy these floors as per their statements.

Wait, if they form an arithmetic progression of difference1 (6,7,8,9), then all four live there. Therefore:

A=6

B could be at7 or8: let's say B=7

C needs to be on odd floor: the only odds here are7 and9. But D is on9, so C would have to be on7—but that's already taken by B. Conflict.

Alternatively, if in this sequence:

A=6 (term1)

D=9 (term4). So difference of3 between A and D.

Then remaining people: B and C need floors at7 and8.

B must be on7 or8—so assign B to7 or8.

C needs to be odd. The only odds in 6,7,8,9 are7 and9. But if B is assigned to7 or8 (which are even/odd?), wait:

Wait, the floors here are6 (even),7 (odd),8 (even),9 (odd). So C must be on an odd floor: either7 or9.

If we assign D=9, then C could be7. Then B would have to take8. But 8 is even—B can live there; the problem only specifies that B lives on7th or8th regardless of parity. Wait, yes—the statement for B was "I live on either the7th or8th floor." So that's their own condition: they must be at7 or8. They don't have a parity requirement.

So in this scenario:

A=6

B=8 (allowed as per their statement)

C=7 (needs to be odd, which 7 is)

D=9

This works! Let's check all conditions:

- A lives three floors below D: D is on9, A on6. Difference of3—correct.

- B is on7 or8: Here B is on8—valid.

- C is on an odd floor: C is on7—valid.

- The four floors form evenly spaced (consecutive): 6,7,8,9 with difference1—yes, they are consecutive and hence evenly spaced.

Additionally, all floors are unique and within the building's range. So this seems to satisfy all conditions.

But wait, let's confirm there isn't another possible solution. Let's check other sequences.

Earlier considered start=5: sequence5,6,7,8 with D on8 (term4), A on5 (term1). Then remaining floors are6 and... Wait no—four people would occupy those four floors. Assigning:

A=5

B needs to be7 or8. If B is on7, then C must be odd: next available odd floor in the sequence is none except if there's another term beyond 8—but there isn't. So only odds are5 and7. A is on5, so C could be on7. Then D would have to be on8. But that leaves sixth person at... Wait no—it's four people: A,B,C,D.

So:

A=5

C=7 (odd)

D=8 (so three floors below D is5 for A)

Then B must be on the remaining floor, which in this case would have to be6? But 6 isn't allowed for B. So conflict. Hence invalid.

Another possible sequence: difference=2 starting at3:3,5,7,9

Check if any pair has a difference of3 between them. Dimesnaine:

A and D must differ by3.

Possible pairs in this sequence:

3 to 6 (invalid)

5 to8 (invalid)

So no such pairs here. Hence invalid.

Another case where A is three below D: D=9, A=6. We already considered that scenario which works.

Are there other possibilities?

What if the arithmetic progression isn't consecutive differences? For example, a longer interval but still four terms spaced evenly apart. Wait, earlier analysis said difference of1 or2 are possible because for four terms in 1-9:

For diff=3: start at x, then x+3d where d=1 gives x+3*3=x+9 which exceeds 9 unless x=0 invalid.

So only diffs=1 and2 are feasible. We already checked those.

Therefore, the only valid solution is A on6, B on8, C on7, D on9? Wait no—earlier assignment was:

A=6

B=8

C=7

D=9

But let's check again:

Floors:6 (A),8 (B),7 (C),9 (D). These four floors are 6,7,8,9. Are they evenly spaced? Yes, each consecutive floor is +1 apart. So the spacing between them is uniform.

Yes, that's correct.

But wait—are there other assignments possible within this sequence?

For example:

A=5

B=7

C=9 (but C must be odd; 9 is allowed)

D=8

Check if A three below D: D=8, so A should be on5. Yes. Then B is on7, which fits. C is on9 (odd). All conditions met.

Wait, this could also work. Let's see:

A=5

B=7

C=9

D=8

But floors would be5,7,8,9. Are these evenly spaced?

Ordering them:5,7,8,9.

Differences:2,1,1—not evenly spaced. So D's statement fails here.

Hence invalid.

Another possibility:

A=4

B=6

C=7 (odd)

D=7—no, same floor not allowed.

Alternatively, A=3

But let's think again of the valid solution we found earlier: A=6, B=8, C=7, D=9. This satisfies all conditions.

Is there any other possible assignment?

Let's check another arithmetic progression with difference1 starting at4: floors4,5,6,7.

A would be on4 (term1), next person5, then6, then7 (D). Then B must be on7 or8. But D is already on7, so if we assign:

A=4

C needs to be odd—floor5 in this sequence. So C=5.

B has to be on7 or8—but 7 and8 aren't in the progression here. The only floors are4,5,6,7. Hence B can't satisfy their condition. Therefore invalid.

Another possible arithmetic progression: difference2 starting at1:1,3,5,7.

Here:

A needs to be three below D. Possible pairs:

D=7 (term4), A=4 (but 4 not in sequence). Invalid.

Alternatively, if the sequence is1,3,5,7 with C needing to be on an odd floor—which they all are—but B must be on7 or8. But this sequence doesn't include8. So invalid for B's condition.

Hence the only valid solution seems to be A=6, B=8, C=7, D=9.

# Answer

Based on the analysis:

- **A** lives three floors below **D**, so if **D** is on floor 9, **A** must be on 6.  
- **B** can only occupy 7th or 8th floor; here assigned to 8.  
- **C** requires an odd floor: the remaining odd floor in the sequence (7).  
- The floors occupied (**6**, **7**, **8**, **9**) form a consecutive arithmetic progression with common difference 1, satisfying D's evenly spaced condition.

Thus, the assignments are:

A: Floor \boxed{6}  
B: Floor \boxed{8}  
C: Floor \boxed{7}  
D: Floor \boxed{9}
