# Thinking

Okay, let's see. So there are four people: A, B, C, and D living on different floors of a 9-story building. Each gives a comment about their floor. I need to figure out which floor each person is on based on their statements.

Starting with Person A: “I live three floors below D.” That means if D is on floor x, then A is on floor x - 3. So the difference between D and A's floors is 4. For example, if D is on 5th, A would be on 2nd. But we need to make sure that all floors are within 1 to 9.

Person B says: “I live on either the 7th or 8th floor.” So B is definitely on 7 or 8. That's straightforward.

Person C claims they live on an odd-numbered floor. The possible odds in a 9-story building are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. But since there are four people and five odd floors, one of the odd floors will be unused.

Person D says: “The floors where the four of us live are evenly spaced apart.” Evenly spaced means that the difference between each consecutive person's floor is the same. Since there are four people, this would form an arithmetic sequence with three intervals. For example, if they are on floors 1, 3, 5, 7, that's spaced by 2 each. Or maybe 2,4,6,8? But let's check that.

First, since B is on 7 or 8, and D's floor must be such that A is three floors below D. Let's consider possible positions for D and see where A would be.

Let me list all possibilities:

If D is on floor x, then A is on x - 3. So x needs to be at least 4 (since x - 3 ≥ 1). Possible Ds: 4-9.

Let's check each possibility:

Case 1: D on 4th floor. Then A would be on 1st. Then the four floors must be evenly spaced. If they are 1, ?, ?, 4. Wait, but there are three intervals between four numbers. So if it's evenly spaced, like 1, 3, 5, 7 or similar. But D is on 4 and A is on 1. Let's see: The four floors would need to be in arithmetic progression with a common difference d. Let’s denote the floors as y, y + d, y + 2d, y + 3d. These should cover all four people. If B is on 7 or 8, let's check if possible.

If D is 4 and A is 1, then maybe the sequence could be 1, 4? No, that only covers two floors. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The entire set of four people's floors must form evenly spaced points. So they have to be in positions like a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d. Let's see if that's possible.

If D is on 4 and A is on 1, then the other two people (B and C) need to fit into this sequence. But B has to be on 7 or 8. Suppose the four floors are 1, x, y, 4. Wait, but for them to be evenly spaced, the difference between each consecutive person should be same. Let's suppose the first term is a, and then next terms add d each time. So:

a (A), a + d (someone), a + 2d (another), a + 3d = D's floor.

But in this case, A is on a, which would mean if A is on 1, then a=1. Then the sequence would be 1, 1 + d, 1 + 2d, 4. So 1 + 3d = 4 → 3d = 3 → d=1. That gives floors 1,2,3,4. But B needs to be on 7 or 8, which is not in this sequence. Contradiction. Therefore D cannot be on 4th floor.

Case 2: D on 5th floor. Then A would be on 2nd (5 - 3 = 2). Now the four floors must form an arithmetic progression with common difference d. Let's see:

Possible sequences starting from A=2 and ending at D=5. So total terms are 4, so positions could be 2, x, y, 5. The differences between consecutive would need to be equal. From 2 to next term is +d, then another +d to reach 2 + 2d = third floor. Then fourth floor is 5. So from second to fifth: over two intervals (from second to third and third to fourth). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

The four floors must be equally spaced. If D is on 5 and A is on 2, then the positions would have to form an arithmetic sequence. Let's suppose the first term is a=2, then next terms are 2 + d, 2 + 2d, ..., up to 5. But since there are four people, including A (2nd) and D (let's say third person?), wait no—the positions must be in order: if they live on floors that are evenly spaced, the difference between each consecutive person's floor is same.

Wait, maybe it's better to model it as an arithmetic progression of four terms. Let’s denote them as a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d. These correspond to A, someone else, C (since they have to be in order?), and D? Wait, but the problem doesn't say anything about the order of their floors. The only thing is that all four are on different floors with equal spacing between each consecutive person.

So for example, possible sequences could be 2,5 as A's floor and D's floor (difference 3), but then we need two more people in between or outside? Wait no—if it's evenly spaced over the four people, there should be three intervals. For instance, if they are on floors 1,4,7,10—but there's only up to 9. So maybe another example: 3,5,7,9 with difference 2 each.

Wait, but in this case, A is supposed to be three below D. Let's see:

If the sequence has a common difference of d, then D's floor would be a + 3d, and A's floor would be a (since there are four terms: term1, term2, term3, term4). But according to A's statement, A is three floors below D. So if A is on term k, and D is on term l, then the difference between their floors should be 3*(l -k). Wait, perhaps not exactly.

Wait, let me clarify: If four people are evenly spaced, the positions can be written as x, x + d, x + 2d, x + 3d. So each consecutive person is one interval of d apart. Therefore, A and D must occupy two terms in this sequence such that their floors differ by 3d (since there are three intervals between them). But according to A's comment, the difference between A and D is exactly 3 floors. Wait, but if they are evenly spaced over four people, then each interval is d. So for example, if the first person is on x, second x + d, third x + 2d, fourth x + 3d. Then the distance from the first to last would be 3d. But A says that he lives three floors below D, which means their positions are separated by exactly 3 floors (i.e., difference of 3). So if they are in this arithmetic sequence, then the total span is 3d = 3 → d=1. Then the four people would be on x, x+1, x+2, x+3. But that can't accommodate B being on 7 or 8 unless x +3 >=8. For example, if x=5, floors would be 5,6,7,8. In this case, D is on 8th floor (x+3), A is on 5th (x). Then the difference between A and D is 3 floors (5 to 8: three intervals of 1 each). But B says they live on 7 or 8. If in this scenario, someone is already on 7 and 8? Wait, but only four people total. So if x=5, then the sequence would be 5,6,7,8. Then A is on 5, D on 8. B could be on 7 or 8, which conflicts because two people can't be on same floor. Therefore this scenario doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe another arithmetic progression where d=2. Let's see: x, x+2, x+4, x+6. Then the difference between first and last is 6d? Wait no—if there are four terms with common difference d, then total span from term1 to term4 is 3d. So if we want A's floor and D's floor separated by exactly three floors (difference of 3), then 3d = 3 → d=1. Which brings us back to the previous case. If they have a different spacing.

Wait, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let's consider all possible arithmetic sequences for four people in 9 floors:

Possible common differences and starting points:

Difference d must be such that x + 3d ≤ 9.

So maximum d is floor((9 -1)/3) = 2 (since 3*3=9, but then the last term would be x+9 which exceeds). Wait, actually for four terms: if first term is x, then fourth term is x + 3d. So to have x + 3d ≤9 → d ≤ floor((9 -x)/3). Since x ≥1.

Possible differences:

If d=1: sequences can start at x from 1 to 6 (since 6+3*1=9). Sequences like 1,2,3,4; up to 6,7,8,9.

d=2: starting x such that x + 6 ≤9 → x≤3. So sequences 1,3,5,7; 2,4,6,8; 3,5,7,9.

d=3: only possible if x +9 ≤9 → x=0 which isn't valid. So no d=3.

So all possible arithmetic sequences for four people:

d=1:
1-4, 2-5, 3-6, 4-7, 5-8, 6-9

d=2:
1-5 (difference 4 between first and last), but wait no—wait the terms would be x, x+2, x+4, x+6. So for d=2:

x=1: 1,3,5,7
x=2:2,4,6,8
x=3:3,5,7,9

So those are all possible four-term arithmetic sequences in 9 floors.

Now, according to D's statement, the four people must be on such a sequence. So one of these is their arrangement.

Additionally, B is either 7 or 8. Let's check which of these sequences include 7 or 8:

For d=1:
4-7: includes 7
5-8: includes 8

For d=2:
1-5 (no), 3-9 includes none? Wait no—wait for x=3, the sequence is 3,5,7,9. So in that case, floor 7 and 9 are included.

So possible sequences where B can be on:

If it's 4-7: then floors 4,5,6,7. But D would be on 7th floor? Wait no—if the sequence is x to x+3d with d=1, but in this case, for each starting point.

Wait let me clarify each possible four-term arithmetic sequence:

Case 1: d=1
a) Starting at 1: floors 1,2,3,4. B can't be here (needs 7 or8).
b) 2,3,4,5. No.
c) 3,4,5,6. No.
d)4,5,6,7. Here D would be on 7th floor if the sequence is assigned to A,B,C,D in order? Wait no—D's position depends on their placement in the arithmetic sequence.

Wait, maybe I need to think of each possible four-term arithmetic progression and see which ones can include B (7 or8) and satisfy other conditions.

Let's check each:

1. d=2 starting at 1: floors 1,3,5,7
   - Here D would be on 7th floor? Because it's the fourth term. If A is three below D... Wait in this case, if D is on 7, then according to A's statement, A should be on 4 (7-3=4). But 4 isn't in the sequence [1,3,5,7]. So conflict here.

2. d=2 starting at 2: floors 2,4,6,8
   - D would be on 8th floor (fourth term). Then A should be on 8-3=5, but 5 isn't in the sequence [2,4,6,8]. Conflict.

3. d=2 starting at 3: floors 3,5,7,9
   - D is on 9th floor. Then A would need to be on 6 (9-3), which is not in the sequence. Conflict.

Now check d=1 sequences:

4. d=1 starting at 1: floors 1,2,3,4. B needs to be here? No. D can't be here because if they are assigned to these floors, but A's statement would require another person three below, which isn't possible as the sequence is only four.

5. d=1 starting at 2: floors 2,3,4,5. Again, no B here.

6. d=1 starting at 3: 3,4,5,6. No B.

7. d=1 starting at 4: floors 4,5,6,7
   - Here D would be on 7th floor (fourth term). Then A should be on 7-3=4th floor. So if the sequence is [4,5,6,7], then:

A is on 4th floor.

D is on 7th.

Then B must be either 7 or8. But in this case, D is already on 7, so B can't be there. Also, C has to be on an odd floor: the sequence here includes 5 only as even? Wait floors are 4 (even),5 (odd),6 (even),7 (odd). So two odds:5 and7. But there's four people. A is on 4, D on7, then remaining B and C need to be on 5 and6. But C must be on odd floor. So if C is on5 (which is in the sequence) or7 (already taken by D). Therefore C could be on5. Then B would have to be on6. But B said they are on7 or8. Conflict here because B can't be on6.

So this doesn't work.

Next:

8. d=1 starting at 5: floors5,6,7,8
   - Here D is on8th floor (fourth term). Then A should be on8-3=5. So if the sequence starts at5 and has common difference1: [5,6,7,8]. Therefore:

A is on5.

D is on8.

Remaining floors are6 and7 for B and C.

B must be on7 or8. But D is already on8, so B would have to be on7.

Then C is left with floor6. But wait, C said they live on an odd-numbered floor. Floor6 is even. Conflict here. So this doesn't work either.

Next:

9. d=1 starting at6: floors6,7,8,9
   - D would be on9th floor (fourth term). Then A should be on9-3=6. Which matches the first term of the sequence [6,7,8,9]. So in this case:

A is on6.

D is on9.

Remaining floors are7 and8 for B and C.

B must be on7 or8. Let's say if it's 7 and8. But there are two people left: B and C. If both take those two floors (7 and8), then we have to assign them. However, C must live on an odd floor. Floors7 and8 include one odd (7) and even (8). So C has to be on7, which is allowed. Then B would be on8. But wait, according to D's statement, the four floors are evenly spaced. Here [6,7,8,9] with difference1 each—so yes, they form an arithmetic sequence.

But let's check all conditions:

A: 6th floor (three below D on9). Correct.

B: On8th floor. B said either7 or8. Okay.

C: If C is on7th floor, which is odd. Correct.

D: On9th floor. All four floors [6,7,8,9] are evenly spaced by1 each. Correct.

But wait, in this case, the sequence is 6,7,8,9 with common difference1. So that works. But let me check if there's any conflict here.

Wait C is on7th floor (odd), which satisfies their statement. B is on8th floor, allowed by their comment. A and D are correctly placed per their statements. All four people on different floors:6,7,8,9. That's correct. So this seems possible.

But wait earlier when I considered d=1 starting at5: the sequence [5,6,7,8] led to a conflict with C needing an odd floor, but in the case of d=1 starting at6: all conditions are satisfied.

Wait so is that the answer? Let me verify again:

A on6, D on9. 9-3=6, correct.

B on8: allowed by B's statement (7 or8).

C must be on odd floor; remaining floors after A(6), D(9) and B(8) are left with C on7th which is odd. So that works.

And the four floors 6,7,8,9 form an arithmetic sequence with difference1. Yes. Therefore this seems to satisfy all conditions.

But wait earlier when I considered d=2 sequences:

For example, in the d=2 starting at3: [3,5,7,9]. Let's see if that could work.

If D is on9th floor (fourth term), then A should be on6. But 6 isn't in this sequence. So conflict.

But wait maybe another assignment? Let me think again.

Wait perhaps the four people are not necessarily assigned to consecutive terms of the arithmetic sequence, but just their floors form such a progression regardless of order. Wait no—the statement says "the floors where the four of us live are evenly spaced apart," which usually means they occupy positions in an arithmetic sequence without any other numbers between them.

But perhaps it's different. Maybe it doesn't have to be consecutive terms? For example, if A is on2 and D on6 (difference4), with B on7 or8, C on odd... Wait but then the spacing would not necessarily form a single common difference unless they are in order. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood.

Wait "evenly spaced apart" could mean that when arranged from lowest to highest floor, each consecutive person is some number of floors apart equally. So for example, if their floors are 3,5,7,9: that's evenly spaced with d=2. Similarly, 6,8 would be d=2 but only two people. But four people require three intervals.

So yes, the initial approach was correct—only sequences where there are four terms in arithmetic progression within 1-9 can satisfy D's statement.

In that case, the valid sequence is [6,7,8,9] with difference1. So that's one possibility. Let's check if there's another possible sequence.

Wait earlier I had d=2 starting at3: [3,5,7,9]. In this case:

If A and D are on 3rd and 9th floors (difference6), but according to A's statement, they should differ by exactly three floors. Wait no—A is three floors below D. So if D is on x, then A is on x-3. But in the sequence [3,5,7,9], if we assign:

If someone is on 3rd floor (x=3), but according to A's statement, that would mean D is also on3th? No, because there are four people.

Wait perhaps another approach: If the four floors form an arithmetic progression with common difference d, then they can be written as a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d. These must all be between1 and9, inclusive.

Now B is on7 or8. So one of these terms is7 or8.

Let's check which sequences include 7 or8:

For example:

If the sequence includes7, possible d's could vary.

Case where D is on9th floor: then a +3d=9. Then A would be on a+0d (since there are four people), but according to A's statement, he should be three below D, so if D is onx, A is onx-3. So in this case, x=9, so A should be on6. But 6 must equal a + kd for some k. Let's see:

If the sequence ends at9 (a+3d=9), and includes6. Then we can have different possibilities.

For example, if d=1: starting from5 to get [5,6,7,8]. Wait no—if it's [6,7,8,9], difference1. So here a=6, d=1. That gives floors6,7,8,9. Which works as previously found.

Alternatively, if the sequence is [3,5,7,9], which has d=2. Here:

a=3, d=2: 3,5,7,9.

In this case, D would be on9th floor (fourth term). Then according to A's statement, A should be on9 -3=6, but 6 is not in the sequence [3,5,7,9]. So conflict here.

So that doesn't work. What if someone else is assigned?

Wait maybe this approach isn't right. Let me try again.

If D is on floor x, then A is onx-3. The four floors must form an arithmetic progression with common difference d. Let's suppose the four terms are a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d.

Given that B is on7 or8, and C is on odd.

So possible sequences where one term is7 or8:

Option1: Sequence includes7 as third term (a + 2d=7), maybe d=2. For example, [5,7,9] but need four terms.

Wait let's try to construct a sequence that includes7 and8 with difference2.

If we have x, x+2, x+4, x+6. If one of these is7 or8.

For example:

x+4=7 → x=3: sequence 3,5,7,9.

Here D could be on9 (fourth term). Then A should be on9-3=6, which isn't in the sequence. Conflict.

If x+6=8: x=2: sequence2,4,6,8. Here B is allowed to be on8. So let's see:

Sequence [2,4,6,8]. If D is on8th floor (fourth term), then A should be on5 (8-3). But 5 isn't in the sequence. Conflict.

If x+ something=7: like third term a + 2d=7 with d=1: so [a,a+1,a+2, a+3]. If one of these is7:

For example, if last term is9, but then D would be on9, A on6 (since 9-3=6). So the sequence needs to include6 and9. But with d=1: [5,6,7,8] as before.

Wait this seems like going in circles.

Alternatively, let's suppose that B is on7th floor. Then possible sequences could have7 in them:

If D is on7th or higher? No, because A has to be three below D. If D were on7, then A would be on4 (since7-3=4). So the four floors must include4 and7 with a common difference.

So arithmetic sequence from4 to7 over three intervals: 4,5,6,7. This is d=1. Then:

A on4, D on7. But in this case, B would need to be on7 or8, but both are occupied by A and D already? Wait no—wait if the sequence is [4,5,6,7], then all four people must be here. So each person (A,B,C,D) is on one of these floors. But according to this:

If A is on4, which is three below D's 7th floor. Then B and C are left with floors5 and6. But B needs to be on7 or8, but those floors are already taken by someone else (if the sequence is [4,5,6,7]). So this doesn't work.

Alternatively, if d=2 for a different starting point:

Sequence could start at1: [1,3,5,7]. Here D would be on7. Then A should be on7-3=4, but 4 isn't in the sequence. Conflict.

If B is on8th floor, which can only happen if d=1 and the last term is8. So starting from5: [5,6,7,8]. Here D would be on8. Then A should be on5 (since8-3=5). Which matches this sequence. Then:

A:5, B: must be on8 or another floor? Wait no—if the four people are on[5,6,7,8], then each of them is assigned to one of these floors. But according to their statements:

A is three below D. If A is on5 and D on8 (difference3), that's correct.

B must be on7 or8: so possible B could be on7 or8. Then C has to be on an odd floor: the remaining floors would be6 (even) if someone else takes one of7 or8. Wait:

Wait, in sequence [5,6,7,8], D is on8. So A is on5.

B can be on7 or8. Suppose B is on7. Then C must be on odd floor: remaining floors are6 (even) and the other options? No—wait all four people need to be assigned:

A:5

D:8

Then B and C left with6 and7.

If B is on7, then C has to be on a different floor. But only six is left. But six is even, which contradicts C's statement (must be odd). So this doesn't work.

Alternatively, if in the sequence [5,6,7,8], D is on8, A is on5. Then B must be on7 or8. If B takes8, but D already is there. Conflict. Therefore no solution here.

So back to previous successful case: the arithmetic sequence starting at6 with d=1: [6,7,8,9]. Here:

A on6 (3 below D's9), which fits A's statement.

B must be on7 or8; in this scenario, B is on8. C has to be on an odd floor: remaining floors are7 and the other one? Wait no—assignments would be:

Floors:6(A),7(C?), 8(B),9(D). Let's check all conditions:

- A:6 (D=9 →9-3=6 ✔️)

- B:8 (allowed per B's statement ✔️)

- C: must be on odd. Available floor is7, which is odd ✔️

- D:9 ✔️

All four people are on different floors.

And the sequence [6,7,8,9] has a common difference of1, so they are evenly spaced ✔️.

Therefore this seems to fit all conditions.

But wait earlier when I considered d=2 starting at3 ([3,5,7,9]):

If someone is assigned to each floor in that sequence. Let's see if that's possible.

Suppose D is on9th floor (fourth term). Then according to A's statement, A should be on6 (9-3=6), but 6 isn't part of the [3,5,7,9] sequence. So conflict here.

Alternatively, maybe another assignment where they aren't in order? Wait no—D has to be one person; their floor is fixed by arithmetic progression.

Wait perhaps D is not on the last term of the arithmetic sequence. But if four people are evenly spaced, then regardless of who they are—their floors must form an arithmetic progression with three equal intervals. So for example, in [3,5,7,9], each consecutive person is two floors apart. If A and D are assigned to any two terms here such that their difference is 6 (which would mean there are three intervals of2). But according to the problem statement, "the four of us live on evenly spaced floors." Which usually implies all five floors between them have equal spacing.

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's check again:

The only possible arithmetic sequence in9 floors that includes B's 7 or8 and satisfies A being three below D is [6,7,8,9]. Therefore the answer should be:

A:6

B:8

C:7 (since it's odd)

D:9

But wait C needs to be on an odd floor. In this scenario, yes—C is on7.

Alternatively, could B be on7 and someone else on8? But D has to be on9 as per A's statement if we take the sequence [6,7,8,9]. If in another arithmetic progression where d=2:

For example, let's see again: [3,5,7,9]. Here, possible assignments:

If B is on7 (allowed), C must be on an odd floor. But all terms are already odd except maybe 9? Wait no—[3,5,7,9] includes only odd floors. So if they were assigned to this sequence, then everyone would have to be on odd floors. But A says that D is three above them. For example:

If in [3,5,7,9], suppose C is on1 (but not part of the arithmetic progression), but no—everyone must fit into the four-term AP.

Wait this seems conflicting. So given all possibilities, only the sequence [6,7,8,9] works.

# Answer

Based on the comments:

- **A** lives three floors below **D**, so if D is on floor x, A is on x−3.
- **B** must be on 7th or 8th. 
- **C** requires an odd-numbered floor.

Considering arithmetic progression for evenly spaced floors (common difference d):

1. For the sequence **6, 7, 8, 9** with d=1:
   - If D is on 9th floor, A must be on \(9 - 3 = 6\).
   - B can occupy 8th (satisfying their statement), leaving C for 7th (odd-numbered).

This satisfies all conditions without overlap. 

**Assignments:**
- **A** → Floor 6  
- **B** → Floor 8  
- **C** → Floor 7  
- **D** → Floor 9  

\boxed{A=6, B=8, C=7, D=9}
