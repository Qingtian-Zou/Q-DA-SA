[Thinking]:
Okay, let's try to figure out which floor each person lives on. So we have four people: A, B, C, and D in a 9-story building. Each makes a statement, and we need to deduce their floors based on that.

Starting with Person A: “I live three floors below D.” That means if D is on floor x, then A is on floor x - 3. So the difference between D's and A's floors is exactly 3. Since it's a 9-story building, we have to make sure that neither of them goes below floor 1 or above floor 9.

Person B: “I live on either the 7th or 8th floor.” So B is definitely on 7 or 8. That narrows it down a bit.

Person C: “I live on an odd-numbered floor.” So floors 1,3,5,7,9 are possibilities for C.

Person D: “The floors where the four of us live are evenly spaced apart.” Evenly spaced means that the difference between each consecutive person's floor is the same. Since there are four people, the spacing would create three intervals. For example, if they are on floors 1, 4, 7, 10—but wait, the building only has 9 floors. So we need to check possible arithmetic sequences within 1-9 with four terms.

First, let's note that all four persons live on different floors because it's stated they're on different floors. Wait, actually, the problem says "different floors of this 9-story apartment building." So each lives on a distinct floor. That's an important point.

So D's statement requires that their living floors are in arithmetic progression. Let's think about possible sequences for four terms in 1-9 with equal spacing.

Possible common differences (d) would need to satisfy 1 + 3d ≤ 9, so d can be up to 2 (since 1 + 3*3=10 which is over). Wait, let's calculate:

If the first term is a and the last term is a + 3d = max_floor. Since there are four terms, the difference between each consecutive pair is d, so total span is 3d. So maximum possible d such that a + 3d ≤9.

Possible common differences for arithmetic progression of four numbers in 1-9:

If d=1: Then floors would be a, a+1, a+2, a+3. But then they are consecutive. For example, 1,2,3,4; up to 6,7,8,9.

If d=2: Floors would be a, a+2, a+4, a+6. So possible starting points: 1,2,3 (since 1+6=7), but 3+6=9. Wait, let's check:

Starting at 1: 1,3,5,7

Starting at 2: 2,4,6,8

Starting at 3: 3,5,7,9

So possible d=2 sequences.

d=3 would require a + 9 ≤9 → a=0, which is invalid. So maximum d=2.

Therefore, the four floors must form an arithmetic progression with difference 1 or 2.

Now let's see how this interacts with the other statements.

First, Person B is on 7 or 8. If D's sequence includes B's floor, that might help. Let's consider possible sequences:

If d=1: The four consecutive floors. Then if one of them is 7 or 8, then Possible sequences could be 5,6,7,8; but wait, that's not a difference of 1—it's already included in the d=1 case. Wait no, for d=1, any four consecutive numbers. So possible sets:

1-4, 2-5, 3-6, 4-7, 5-8, 6-9.

If B is on 7 or 8, then sequences could be 4-7 (includes 7), so if the sequence is 4,5,6,7; but that includes three consecutive numbers. Similarly, 5,6,7,8 would include 7 and 8. But wait, in this case, B's floor would have to be part of such a sequence.

Alternatively, for d=2 sequences:

1,3,5,7

2,4,6,8

3,5,7,9

If the four people are on these floors. Let's see if any of these include 7 or 8 (B's possible floors). The first and third sequences have 7 and 8 respectively.

So for example, in the sequence 1,3,5,7: D lives here, so A would be three below D. Wait, but according to Person A's statement, if D is on floor x, then A is on x-3. Let's check each possible d=2 sequences:

First sequence (d=2): 1,3,5,7

If D is on 7, then A would be on 4 (7 -3 =4). But in the first sequence (1,3,5,7), floor 4 isn't included. So that can't happen.

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't correct. Let's re-examine.

Person A says they are three floors below D. So if D is on x, then A is on x-3. Therefore, both x and x-3 must be in the arithmetic progression of D's statement. Since all four people (A,B,C,D) are part of the same evenly spaced set, which for d=2 sequences would include only those starting at 1,2,3.

Wait, if we take a d=2 sequence like 2,4,6,8: Then floors 2,4,6,8. If D is on 8 (the highest floor in this sequence), then A should be on 5 (8-3=5). But 5 isn't part of the 2,4,6,8 sequence. Therefore, that can't work.

Similarly, if d=1 sequences: For example, floors 5,6,7,8. Then D could be on 8, so A would need to be on 5 (8-3=5). But in this case, the arithmetic progression is consecutive numbers, so yes, 5 and 8 are part of that sequence. So if D is on 8, then A is on 5, which is three floors below.

But wait, let's check all possibilities step by step.

First, possible d=2 sequences:

1,3,5,7

2,4,6,8

3,5,7,9

Possible d=1 sequences (consecutive):

1-4, 2-5, 3-6, 4-7, 5-8, 6-9.

Now, Person B is on 7 or 8. Let's see where these floors appear in the possible arithmetic progressions.

In d=2 sequences:

1,3,5,7: includes 7

2,4,6,8: includes 8

3,5,7,9: doesn't include 7 or 8 except maybe if someone else is on them. Wait no, C has to be on odd floors, so B being on even floor (7 and 8 are mixed here; wait B could be on 7 which is odd? No, wait person B says they live on either 7th or 8th floor. So regardless of parity, B is on 7 or 8.

Wait but C has to be on an odd floor: 1,3,5,7,9.

So if the arithmetic progression includes even numbers where needed.

Let me try each possible D's sequence and see if A can fit three below, then check for B and C.

First, let's consider d=2 sequences.

Case 1: D is on 7 (sequence 1,3,5,7). Then according to A, A should be on 4 (7-3=4). But floor 4 isn't in this sequence. So invalid.

Case 2: D is on 8 (sequence 2,4,6,8). Then A would need to be on 5 (8-3=5), but 5 isn't in the sequence 2,4,6,8. Invalid.

Case 3: D is on 9 (sequence 3,5,7,9)? Wait no, d=2 sequences for four floors can't go beyond 9 if starting at 3: 3,5,7,9. So yes, that's a possible sequence.

If D is on 9, then A would be on 6 (9-3=6). But floor 6 isn't in the sequence 3,5,7,9. So invalid.

So none of the d=2 sequences work because when we try to place D such that A is three below, it doesn't fit into those progressions. Therefore, maybe the arithmetic progression must be with difference d=1 (consecutive floors). Let's check those.

Possible consecutive sequences:

Let's list all possible four-consecutive-floor sequences in 9-story building:

1-4: [1,2,3,4]

2-5: [2,3,4,5]

3-6: [3,4,5,6]

4-7: [4,5,6,7]

5-8: [5,6,7,8]

6-9: [6,7,8,9]

Now check if any of these can accommodate A and D with the three-floor difference.

Take each sequence:

1-4: If D is on 4, then A would be on 1 (4-3=1). Then B must be on 7 or 8, which are not in this set. So invalid because B can't be there.

2-5: If D is on 5, A would be on 2 (5-3=2). But then floors occupied would be 2 and 5. Then C must be on an odd floor not already taken. The remaining odds are 1,3,7,9. B needs to be on 7 or 8. So possible: D(5), A(2), B(7 or 8), C(remaining). Let's see:

Floors used in the sequence would be 2,4,5 (wait no, consecutive floors are 2,3,4,5. If they live on these four floors as per arithmetic progression with d=1, then all four people must be here. But A is supposed to be three below D. Wait if D is on 5, then A would need to be on 2 (5-3=2). So in this case, the sequence includes 2 and 5. Then C has to be on an odd floor not in {2,3,4,5}. The remaining odds are 1,7,9. B needs to be on 7 or 8.

So possible assignments:

D:5

A:2

Then available floors for B and C: from the sequence [2,3,4,5], but occupied by D, A (but wait no—if they live on four different floors in an arithmetic progression of consecutive numbers. Wait if it's a d=1 progression like 2-5, then all four people are spread across those four floors? Or is it that the entire set forms a consecutive sequence?

Wait maybe I misinterpret D's statement. The problem says "the floors where the four of us live are evenly spaced apart." So does that mean they form an arithmetic progression with equal spacing between each floor, regardless of how many people there are in between? For example, if A is on 2 and D is on 5, then B could be on 3 or 4. But since all four must have floors that are evenly spaced.

So the entire set {A,B,C,D} forms an arithmetic progression. Therefore, their floor numbers form such a sequence with equal differences between consecutive terms in sorted order.

Therefore, if they live on [2,3,4,5], then that's an arithmetic progression with d=1. So all four are there. But according to A's statement, D is three above A. In this case, the lowest floor would be 2 (A), and highest D at 5. Then between them: floors 2,3,4,5. The differences are 1 each. Wait but in that sequence, from 2 to 3 is +1, 3 to 4 +1, etc. So the spacing between consecutive people would be 1 floor apart. However, D's statement says "evenly spaced," which could mean equal intervals regardless of how many terms are in between. For four people, there are three gaps. If they live on [2,5], that would require d=3 (since 5-2=3), but that's only two floors for four people? Wait no, the entire set must form an arithmetic progression. So if all four floors are part of a single AP.

For example, in [1,4,7], which has difference 3. But with four terms, it's possible as long as they fit within 9 stories. However, our earlier analysis showed that for d=2 sequences work better.

Wait maybe the confusion is arising from different interpretations. Let me clarify D's statement again: "The floors where the four of us live are evenly spaced apart." So when we sort their floor numbers in order, each consecutive pair differs by a constant difference. For example, if they live on 1,3,5,7 (difference 2), that's even spacing. If they live on 2,4,6,8, same thing.

Therefore, the entire set must form an arithmetic progression with some common difference d. Therefore, possible sequences as we listed before: for four people in a 9-story building, only possible differences are 1 or 2 (since higher differences would require floors beyond 9).

Now let's check each possible AP:

Case 1: AP with d=3.

Possible sequence starting at 1: 1,4,7. But that's three terms. To have four people, next term would be 10, which is invalid. So no such sequence in 9 stories.

Case 2: d=2 as before: [1,3,5,7], [2,4,6,8], [3,5,7,9].

d=1 sequences are four consecutive floors.

Now let's see if these can satisfy A's condition (A is three below D) and B/C conditions.

Let's take the AP with d=2: 1,3,5,7.

If all four people live here. Then:

D could be on any of these floors. Let's check each possibility for D in this sequence.

Subcase 1a: D on 7. Then A should be on 4 (7-3). But 4 isn't in the AP [1,3,5,7]. So invalid.

Subcase 1b: D on 5. Then A would need to be on 2 (5-3=2), but 2 isn't in this sequence either.

Subcase 1c: D on 3. Then A should be on 0, which is invalid.

Subcase 1d: D on 1. Then A would be on -2, impossible.

Thus, the AP [1,3,5,7] doesn't work with A's statement.

Next AP: [2,4,6,8].

Check if any placement of D here allows A to be three below.

Subcase:

If D is on 8, then A should be on 5 (8-3=5). But 5 isn't in this sequence. So invalid.

D on 6: A would need to be on 3 (6-3=3). Not in the sequence [2,4,6,8].

D on 4: A needs to be on 1 (4-3=1). Also not in the sequence.

So this AP also doesn't work.

Next AP: [3,5,7,9].

Check D placements:

If D is on 9: then A should be on 6 (9-3=6). Not in the AP. Invalid.

D on 7: A would need to be on 4. Not in the sequence.

D on 5: A needs to be on 2. No.

D on 3: A on 0. Nope.

So none of these d=2 sequences work with A's statement.

Now consider APs with d=1 (consecutive floors). Let's check each possible consecutive four-floor set.

First, the sequence [5,6,7,8]. This includes B's possible floor (7 or 8). So let's see:

If D is on 8, then according to A, A should be on 5 (8-3=5). Then we have floors: 5 and 8 occupied by A and D. The consecutive sequence [5,6,7,8] would require all four people to live here. So C must be on an odd floor not in this set. But the available odds are 1,3,9.

But B needs to be on 7 or 8, which is already taken by D (if D is on 8). Wait, no—B can only be on 7 or 8. If A and D are on 5 and 8, then the consecutive sequence would have all four in [5,6,7,8]. Therefore:

A:5

D:8

Then B must be either 7 or 8. But if D is already on 8, then B must be on 7.

C has to be on an odd floor not in {5,6,7,8}, so C can be on 1,3,9.

But all four people are supposed to live within this consecutive sequence [5,6,7,8], but A and D already take two of them. Wait no—the AP here is the entire set must form an arithmetic progression with equal spacing, which in this case would mean they occupy floors 5,6,7,8 (d=1). So all four people are on these floors.

But according to B's statement, B is on 7 or 8. Then if D is on 8 and A on 5, then C must be on one of the remaining odds: in this case, only odd floor left would be none, because [5,6,7,8] includes even floors except 5 (if we consider d=1). Wait no, within consecutive numbers from 5 to 8:

Floors are 5,6,7,8. Among these, the odds are 5 and 7. So if B is on 7 or 8, then possible assignments:

If D is on 8 (so A is on 5), then remaining floors for C and B would be 6 and 7.

But C must be on an odd floor: only 5 and 7 are odds in this set. But A is already on 5, so C can only be on 7. Then B would have to be on 6 or the other even number? Wait no:

Wait if all four people live in [5,6,7,8], then each of them must occupy one floor here. So possible assignments:

A:5

D:8

Then remaining floors are 6 and 7 for B and C.

But B has to be on 7 or 8. If D is on 8, then B can only be on 7 (since 8 is taken). Then C would have to take floor 6, but C must be on an odd floor. But 6 is even. Contradiction. Therefore, this scenario doesn't work.

Alternatively, if the AP is [4,5,6,7], which includes B's possible floors:

If D is on 7 (so A would need to be on 4: 7-3=4). Then all four people are in [4,5,6,7]. So C must be on an odd floor here. The odds are 5 and 7. But if B is on 7 or 8:

If D is on 7 (so A on 4), then remaining floors for B and C: 5 and 6.

B needs to be on 7 or 8, but in this AP [4,5,6,7], the highest floor is 7. So if B must be on 7, which is already taken by D, that's impossible. Therefore invalid.

Next AP: [3,4,5,6]. Includes odds only at 3 and 5. If all four live here:

A would need to be three below D. Let's see possible placements.

If D is on 6 (so A on 3). Then floors occupied are 3,4,5,6 by all four people. B needs to be on 7 or 8, which aren't in this set. So invalid.

Next AP: [2,3,4,5]. Includes odds at 3 and 5.

If D is on 5 (so A on 2). Then C must be on an odd floor not taken by others. The available odds are 3 and maybe higher? Wait in this set, only 3 and 5 are included. If B needs to be on 7 or 8, which aren't here. So invalid.

Last AP: [6,7,8,9]. Includes D's possible floors if any:

If D is on 9 (A would need to be on 6). Then all four live in [6,7,8,9]. C must be on an odd floor there: only 7. B needs to be on 7 or 8.

So assignments could be:

D:9

A:6

Then remaining floors for B and C are 7 and 8.

B has to choose between 7 and 8. Suppose B is on 7 (odd?), wait no—C must be on an odd floor. If D is on 9, A on 6, then the consecutive set [6,7,8,9]. Then:

If C takes 7 (the only odd in this range), then B would have to take 8. But B can be on 7 or 8. However, if C is on 7, which is allowed, but wait D's statement requires all four floors are evenly spaced. So the entire set must form an AP with difference d=1.

Wait in this case, [6,7,8,9] has a common difference of 1 (d=1). If they live here:

A:6

D:9

Then B and C need to be on 7 and 8. But C must be on an odd floor. In the set [6,7,8,9], the odds are 7 only if we consider that 7 is in there. Wait no—wait within this consecutive sequence:

Floors:6 (even),7 (odd),8 (even),9 (odd). So C must be on either 7 or 9.

If B is to take one of 7 or 8, and C takes the other odd floor which would be 9 if possible. But in this case, D is already on 9. Wait no:

Wait all four people are supposed to live within their own AP. So if they are in [6,7,8,9], then each person must occupy one of these floors.

So possibilities:

A:6

D:9 (so A is three below D)

Then remaining floors for B and C: 7 and 8.

B can be on 7 or 8. If B is on 7, which is odd? Wait no—B's statement says they live on either 7th or 8th floor regardless of parity. So even if it's an odd number like 7, but in this case, C needs to be on an odd floor.

So:

If A:6

D:9

Then B can take 7 (which is allowed as per B's statement), and then C would have to take 8. But 8 is even, which contradicts C needing to be on an odd floor. Alternatively, if B takes 8, then C has to take 7. That works because 7 is odd.

So assignment:

A:6

D:9

B:8 (since they can choose either)

C:7

This way:

All four are in the AP [6,7,8,9] with difference 1.

A is three below D: 6 and 9 differ by 3. Correct.

B is on 8th floor, which matches their statement (either 7 or 8).

Wait but wait C is on 7, which is odd. That works.

But let me check again:

Floors assigned:

A:6

B:8

C:7

D:9

All different floors. Check:

A says they are three below D: 6 and 9 differ by 3. Yes.

B is on 8, which is allowed (either 7 or 8).

C is on 7, an odd floor. Correct.

All four in the AP [6,7,8,9], difference of 1. So evenly spaced. Correct.

This seems to fit all conditions. But wait, let's check other possibilities in this case.

Alternatively, if B takes 7 and C takes 8:

A:6

D:9

B:7 (allowed by their statement)

C:8 (which is even, but contradicts C's need for odd). So invalid.

Thus the only valid assignment here is A:6, D:9, B:8, C:7.

But wait in this case, all floors are 6,7,8,9. But there's also floor 5 and others not occupied. Is that okay? Yes, because they don't need to occupy every possible odd or even; just their specific assignments as per the constraints.

Wait but let's check another AP: [4,5,6,7]. Could this work?

If D is on 7 (so A would be on 4). Then all four live here. C needs to be on an odd floor in {4,5,6,7}, which are 5 and 7. B needs to be on 7 or 8. But if they live in [4,5,6,7], then the highest is 7, so B can't take 8. Therefore invalid.

Another possible AP: [3,4,5,6]. If D is on 6 (A would need to be on 3). Then all four here. C must be on odd floors in this set: 3 and 5. So if A is on 3, then remaining odds are 5. B needs to be on 7 or 8 not in the set. Invalid.

Similarly for other APs.

So the only valid solution seems to be:

A:6

B:8

C:7

D:9

But wait C is supposed to live on an odd floor, which is satisfied here (7). All conditions met?

Let me verify again:

D says all four floors are evenly spaced. The floors 6,7,8,9 have a common difference of 1. Yes.

A lives three below D: 6 and 9 differ by 3. Correct.

B is on 8th floor (allowed). C on 7th (odd). All different floors. Seems okay.

Is there another possible solution?

Let me check if there's a d=2 AP that works with some other assignments.

Wait, earlier when I considered the AP [5,6,7,8], but couldn't find valid assignment because of conflict with C's parity. But maybe another approach.

Suppose D is on 9 (AP could be [3,5,7,9]). Wait no, in this case:

If they are in [3,5,7,9] with d=2.

Then possible assignments:

A would need to be three below D. Let's see where D can be placed here.

In the sequence 3,5,7,9 (d=2), each term is two apart.

So if A needs to be three floors below D, which isn't directly in this AP since d=2 skips every other floor.

For example, if D is on 9, then A should be on 6. But 6 isn't in the sequence [3,5,7,9]. So invalid.

If D is on 7, A would need to be on 4 (7-3=4), not in the sequence.

D on 5: A on 2. No.

So no luck here.

Another AP possibility with d=1 and starting at different floors:

Wait what about [6,7,8,9], which we already considered. That seems to be the only valid one.

Alternatively, could there be a non-consecutive but evenly spaced in terms of intervals? For example, if they are on 2,4,6,8 (d=2), but A would need to be three below D. Let's see:

If D is on 8, then A should be on 5. Not in the set.

D on 6: A needs to be on 3. Not in the set.

So no.

Another angle: Maybe C's floor being odd affects where B and others can be.

In our previous solution, C is on 7 (odd), which works. But suppose another scenario:

If AP is [5,6,7,8], but we saw that leads to conflict with C needing an odd floor in the set. Wait no—if they are in this AP, then odds are 5 and 7. If B takes 7 or 8.

Wait if A is on 5 (D on 8), then:

A:5

D:8

Then remaining floors for B and C are 6 and 7.

B can be on 7, which leaves floor 6 for C, but that's even. Contradiction. So invalid.

Alternatively, AP [2,3,4,5]. A would need to be three below D:

If D is on 5 (A on 2). Then all four live here. B needs to be on 7 or 8 not in the set. Invalid.

So no other possibilities seem valid. Therefore, the only solution that fits all conditions is:

A:6

B:8

C:7

D:9

But let me check once more for any oversight.

Wait another thought—could there be a case where D's AP includes non-consecutive floors but still evenly spaced? For example, if they are on 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th (d=1), which is consecutive. But we already checked that and found issues with C.

Alternatively, could the spacing refer to equal intervals between all four people regardless of their order? Like sorted floors: x < y < z < w, such that y -x = z -y = w -z = d. So yes, that's what an arithmetic progression is.

Thus, our previous conclusion holds.

[Answer]
Based on the given statements and logical deductions:

D lives on the 9th floor since their floors must form evenly spaced (arithmetic progression). For D to be three floors above A, if D were lower than 9, there wouldn't be enough space for a valid AP.
A, being three floors below D, then occupies the 6th floor.
C lives on an odd-numbered floor not already occupied by others. The available option is the 7th floor.
B must choose between the 7th or 8th floor. Since C takes the 7th, B logically resides on the 8th.
Thus, the floors are:

A: \boxed{6}

B: \boxed{8}

C: \boxed{7}

D: \boxed{9}
