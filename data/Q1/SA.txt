[Answer]
Based on the four comments:

A + 3 = D
B = 7 or B = 8
C âˆˆ {1,3,5,7,9} (9-story building, right?)

The key is D's comment: evenly spaced apart. Combining this with A's comment, this means that the 3 floors must be d, 2d, or 3d, assuming d is the common difference. However, 3 cannot be completely divided by 2, so either d = 3 or 3d = 3.

If d = 3, then let's write all A, B, C, and D's floors as X, X+d, X+2d, X+3d. However, X>=1, which means X+3d>=10. This is conflicting with the fact that the building has only 9 floors. Therefore, 3d = 3, which means d = 1.

Now that we have determined that d is 1, we can confirm that A lives on the lowest, and D lives on the highest floor of the four people, and B and C live between them, which means B and C's floor numbers must be continuous. Now let's consider what B and C say. C says that he/she lives on an odd-numbered floor. Because B and C's floor numbers must be continuous, this means that B's floor number must be an even number, and B says that it is either 7 or 8 -- so it must be 8. Because this is a 9-story building, C must be living on a floor lower than the 9th floor -- remember that D lives on the highest floor of the four. Therefore, C lives on the 7th floor.

In conclusion, A lives on the 6th floor, B lives on the 8th floor, C lives on the 7th floor, and D lives on the 9th floor.
