# Thinking

We have a puzzle. Four people A, B, C, and D each on distinct floors from 1 to 9 inclusive (probably 1 lowest to 9 highest). They make statements about their floors. We need to determine which floor each person lives on.

Statements:

A: "I live three floors below D."
So if D is on floor x, A is on floor x-3. Must be between 1 and 9 inclusive; x-3 >= 1 => x>=4. Also distinct.

B: "I live on either the 7th or 8th floor." So B is floor 7 or 8.

C: "I live on an odd-numbered floor." So C is 1,3,5,7,9.

D: "The floors where the four of us live are evenly spaced apart."

Interpretation: The set of four floor numbers {floor(A), floor(B), floor(C), floor(D)} have equal spacing between consecutive sorted values. That is, they form an arithmetic progression (AP). So difference d > 0 integer such that floors = a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, all within 1-9 inclusive distinct. Since four floors evenly spaced. They need not be adjacent; just AP.

Goal: find unique solution consistent with each statement and distinctness.

Approach brute force mentally or reasoning.

Let’s denote D's floor f_D. Then A is f_D -3. Must be at least 1, so f_D≥4. Also ≤9, f_D-3 ≤9 => f_D ≤12 but bound 9 anyway.

We also need B=7 or 8. C odd.

Additionally the set {f_D-3, f_D, f_B, f_C} must be an AP of 4 terms.

Let’s denote sorted list: maybe not necessarily in order? But AP means if we sort them ascending, differences equal. Equivalent to that multiset forms arithmetic progression. That means max-min = 3*d where d positive integer. Also the middle two are separated by d each; and min + max = 2*mean etc.

Let's analyze possibilities for f_D. Let's list possible four-term APs within 1-9 inclusive. They must be 4 distinct integers between 1 and 9 forming arithmetic progression with common difference d (integer). Since range max-min=3d ≤8 => d≤2? Because if min≥1, max≤9 so difference <=8. So d can be 1 or 2.

Case 1: d = 1: consecutive floors. Then set would be {a,a+1,a+2,a+3} with a from 1 to 6. That's AP of 4 consecutive floors.

Case 2: d = 2: steps of two. Then set {a,a+2,a+4,a+6}. Min≥1, max≤9 => a ≤3? Because a+6 <=9 => a<=3. So a ∈ {1,2,3}.

d cannot be greater than 2 because then difference would exceed floor range. d=0 not allowed distinct.

Now we need to fit A=f_D-3 and D=f_D inside these AP sets with B 7/8 and C odd. Let's test each AP candidate and see if possible.

First, consider d=1 consecutive floors:

Set options:
1) {1,2,3,4}
2) {2,3,4,5}
3) {3,4,5,6}
4) {4,5,6,7}
5) {5,6,7,8}
6) {6,7,8,9}

Within each set we need to assign persons: A = D-3. So difference between D and A is 3 floors. In consecutive sets difference of 3 exists only between the first and last? Let's see: If set = {a,a+1,a+2,a+3}, then elements a (min) and a+3(max) differ by 3. That means if A = D-3, possible assignments: either D is max a+3 and A is min a; or D could be third element? Let's see difference: If D=a+1, then D-3 = a-2 not in set. So only viable if D is the last element (a+3) and A is first a. So D must be top of the consecutive block, A bottom.

Thus for consecutive sets we need D = a+3, A = a. Check other persons: B=7 or 8; C odd. Let's examine each set:

Set1 {1,2,3,4}: D=4, A=1. B must be 7/8 not in set => impossible.

Set2 {2,3,4,5}: D=5, A=2. B not in set (since 7 or 8) impossible.

Set3 {3,4,5,6}: D=6, A=3. B cannot be 7/8 -> impossible.

Set4 {4,5,6,7}: D=7, A=4. B can be 8? Wait B must be 7 or 8. 7 is already used by D; can't use same floor. So B could not be 7 (occupied). B cannot be 8 because 8 not in set -> impossible.

Set5 {5,6,7,8}: D=8, A=5. B must be 7 or 8. 8 occupied by D, so B could be 7 (free). That works. C odd: remaining floor from set is 6? Wait set includes floors 5(A),6?,7(B),8(D). That's all four. 6 is even, not odd; but we need C odd. However we used only three persons: A=5, B=7, D=8 leaving floor 6 for C. But floor 6 is even, violates C odd. So impossible.

Set6 {6,7,8,9}: D=9, A=6. B must be 7 or 8; both available. Which assignment? Let's test each.

If B=7: then remaining floors are 8 for C. Floor 8 is even, not odd => invalid.

If B=8: then remaining floor 7 for C; 7 odd so ok. So we have potential solution: D=9, A=6, B=8, C=7.

Check constraints:

- A lives 3 floors below D? D=9, A=6 diff 3 => yes.
- B on 7 or 8? B=8 yes.
- C odd floor? C=7 odd yes.
- Floors evenly spaced? set {6,7,8,9} difference 1, consecutive indeed. So this satisfies all.

Thus solution: D=9, A=6, B=8, C=7.

But wait we used all floors distinct; yes. Check that all persons live on different floors: A=6, B=8, C=7, D=9 -> distinct.

Check B's statement: "I live on either the 7th or 8th floor." We set B=8, okay.

Thus there is a valid solution.

However we need to ensure uniqueness. Might there be another? Let's test d=2 possibilities.

For d=2, sets:

a=1 => {1,3,5,7}
a=2 => {2,4,6,8}
a=3 => {3,5,7,9}

Within each set we must satisfy A=D-3. So difference between D and A is 3 floors.

We need to check which assignments produce such difference. Let's analyze each set:

Set S1: {1,3,5,7}. We need two floors in set differing by 3. Which pairs differ by 3? 1->4 not in set; 3->6 not; 5->8 not; 7->10 not. So no pair diff 3 within the set. Therefore S1 impossible.

Set S2: {2,4,6,8}. Need difference 3. 2->5 (not); 4->7(not),6->9(not),8->11. No.

Set S3: {3,5,7,9}. Need diff 3: 3->6 (not). 5->8(not). 7->10 not. 9->12 no. So none.

Thus d=2 sets can't accommodate A & D difference of 3.

Therefore only the consecutive set 6 works.

So unique solution: A floor 6, B floor 8, C floor 7, D floor 9. But need to check B's statement: "I live on either the 7th or 8th floor." He could be 8; good. Could we also assign B=7? That would leave C floor 8? but C must odd; not.

Thus unique solution found.

Let's double-check if any other consecutive set might satisfy if D not max? Wait earlier we assumed that for d=1, difference 3 only between min and max because it's arithmetic progression of consecutive integers. But what about possibility where A = D-3 but maybe D is third element (a+2) and A second element? Let's test: In {a,a+1,a+2,a+3}, if D=a+2, then A=D-3= a-1 not in set. If D=a+1, A=a-2 not; etc. So indeed only D is max.

Thus we found unique solution.

But check B's statement: "I live on either the 7th or 8th floor." This means that B could be on floor 7 or 8 but must choose one. We had B=8. That works.

Now confirm that all conditions are satisfied:

- A: lives three floors below D (6 below 9 yes).
- B: lives on 7th or 8th floor (B=8 ok)
- C: lives on odd-numbered floor (C=7 ok)
- D: floors evenly spaced apart? The four floors {6,7,8,9} are evenly spaced by 1.

Therefore answer: A: 6th floor; B: 8th floor; C: 7th floor; D: 9th floor.

Double-check: Are they all distinct? Yes.

But let's consider if there is any scenario where B=7 and C=8 but violates odd requirement. So no.

Thus final answer unique: A on 6, B on 8, C on 7, D on 9.

Let's craft explanation.

We might also mention reasoning: use AP sets; only consecutive set {6-9} works due to difference constraints. Provide step-by-step deduction.

Also check that there is no scenario where B=8 but C could be 5? Wait we used all four floors 6,7,8,9 but we didn't consider possibility of assigning C to floor 5 and some other assignment for B? But we must use exactly those floors in set. Because the AP sets are fixed; we can't have extra floor outside set because only these four people occupy them. So if set is {6,7,8,9}, all four persons must occupy them.

Thus final answer as above. Provide explanation with reasoning.

### How we got there

1. **A’s clue**  
   `A lives three floors below D`.  
   If D is on floor \(x\), then A must be on floor \(x-3\).  
   Both must be between 1 and 9, so \(4 \le x \le 9\).

2. **D’s clue**  
   “The floors where the four of us live are evenly spaced apart.”  
   This means the four occupied floors form an arithmetic progression (AP) with a common difference \(d>0\).  

   For any AP of 4 terms within 1–9,  
   \[
   f_{\max}-f_{\min}=3d\le8 \;\Rightarrow\; d=1 \text{ or } d=2.
   \]

3. **Check the two possible APs**

   *\(d = 2\)* – the only sets are  
   \(\{1,3,5,7\}\), \(\{2,4,6,8\}\), \(\{3,5,7,9\}\).  
   None of these contain two floors that differ by exactly 3, so A and D can’t fit here.

   *\(d = 1\)* – the only sets are  
   \[
   \{1,2,3,4\},\,\{2,3,4,5\},\,\{3,4,5,6\},\,\{4,5,6,7\},
   \{5,6,7,8\},\,\{6,7,8,9\}
   \]
   In a consecutive block the only pair that differs by 3 is the first and last element.  
   Hence D must be on the top floor of the block, A on the bottom.

4. **Apply the other clues**

   * B lives on the 7th or 8th floor.  
   * C lives on an odd‑numbered floor.  

   Going through each consecutive set:

   - \{1–4\}, \{2–5\}, \{3–6\} – no 7/8 for B.
   - \{4–7\} – 7 is taken by D, 8 not in the block → impossible.
   - \{5–8\} – gives C on floor 6 (even) → violates C’s clue.
   - **\{6–9\}** – works:  
     * D = 9 (top), A = 6 (bottom).  
     * B can take either 7 or 8; only 8 leaves an odd floor for C.  
       So B = 8, and the remaining floor 7 goes to C.

5. **Check consistency**

   - A is 3 floors below D: \(9-6=3\). ✔️  
   - B is on the 8th floor (allowed): ✔️  
   - C is on an odd floor (7th): ✔️  
   - The four floors \(\{6,7,8,9\}\) are evenly spaced by 1: ✔️  

No other set satisfies all conditions. Thus this assignment is unique.

---

**Final Floors**

| Person | Floor |
|--------|-------|
| D      | 9th   |
| A      | 6th   |
| C      | 7th   |
| B      | 8th   |

All constraints are met and the solution is complete.
