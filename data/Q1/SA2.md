We need assign distinct floors 1-9. D's statement: the four floors are evenly spaced apart meaning difference between consecutive is same d. So they form arithmetic progression of length4 within 1-9. Possible sequences: starting floor s, diff d>0 integer. s +3d <=9. possibilities: d=1 => floors s,s+1,s+2,s+3 any from1-6. d=2 => s up to5: s,s+2,s+4,s+6. d=3 => s up to3: s,s+3,s+6,s+9 but 9 max so s can be1 or? s=1 gives 1,4,7,10 invalid >9. So only d=2 possible maybe d=1 also. Check A: A lives three floors below D: floor(A)=floor(D)-3.

B: either 7 or8. C odd.

We need assign floors consistent with arithmetic sequence and distinct.

Let's test d=2 sequences: start s=1 -> floors1,3,5,7. D could be any of these. A must be D-3 so if D=4? not in set. So D cannot be 4 etc. Let's try enumerate.

Let’s assign D floor X. Then A=X-3 must be positive and part of sequence too. So X-3 also in the four floors. Since they are evenly spaced, the difference between consecutive is d. For an arithmetic progression, if we have floor numbers a,b,c,d sorted. If D is at some position k (1 to4), then A is 3 less than D. In the sequence with diff d, positions differ by multiples of d. So X-3 must equal X -3 = X + m*(-d) where m integer. So 3 = m*d. So d divides 3. d can be1 or3. But we saw d=3 impossible earlier? Let's check: if d=3, sequence length4: floors s,s+3,s+6,s+9 <=9 => s can be1 only gives 1,4,7,10 invalid >9. So no d=3. Thus d must be1. Then floors consecutive numbers. Then A is 3 below D means positions differ by 3. In consecutive sequence of length4, the lowest floor +0, +1,+2,+3. For difference 3, D must be highest floor (position4) and A lowest floor. So floors are X-3,X-2,X-1,X with X=D. The lowest is X-3 = A. So A floor=lowest, D highest.

Thus the four floors are consecutive numbers: A, B?, C?, D in ascending order. And A = D-3.

B either 7 or8 must be one of these four. C odd number.

Let's assign floors 1-4? If D=4 then A=1. Sequence 1,2,3,4. B could be 7/8 no fit. So not.

If D=5 => A=2 sequence 2,3,4,5. B none 7/8.

D=6 => A=3 seq3-6. B none.

D=7 => A=4 seq4-7 includes B could be7 or8? 7 possible. Good. Sequence floors:4(A),5?,6?,7(D). B must be 7 or8 but 7 is D so cannot. So no.

D=8 => A=5 seq5-8 includes B could be7 or8; 8 is D can't, 7 possible. So B=7. Sequence floors:5(A),6(C?),7(B),8(D). Need C odd floor among remaining? Remaining floor 6 even so cannot. So fail.

D=9 => A=6 seq6-9 includes B could be7 or8; choose 7 or8 not D. But sequence 6,7,8,9. B could be7 or8. Let's test: If B=7 then remaining floor 8 for C must be odd? 8 even no. If B=8 then remaining floor7 for C odd yes. So solution: Floors: A=6, B=8, C=7, D=9. Check all: A three below D:6 vs9 diff3 good. B on 8 ok. C odd 7 yes. D floors evenly spaced? 6,7,8,9 consecutive yes. Works.

# Answer

**Solution**

| Person | Floor |
|--------|-------|
| **A** | 6 |
| **B** | 8 |
| **C** | 7 |
| **D** | 9 |

**Why this works**

1. **Even spacing (D’s clue)**  
   The four floors must form an arithmetic progression with equal gaps.  
   With only 9 stories, the only way for A to be *exactly* three floors below D is if the four floors are consecutive numbers:  
   \( \text{A},\,\text{?,?},\,\text{?,?},\,\text{D} \).  
   Thus D must be the highest of the four, and A the lowest.

2. **A’s clue** – “I live three floors below D.”  
   This forces the sequence to be consecutive with A on floor \(x\) and D on floor \(x+3\).

3. **B’s clue** – “I live on either the 7th or 8th floor.”  
   In a consecutive block of four, only one of those floors can be taken by B.

4. **C’s clue** – “I live on an odd‑numbered floor.”  

Checking all possibilities for the topmost floor (D):

- If D = 9 → the block is \(6,7,8,9\).  
  - B can be on 8.  
  - The remaining floor for C is 7, which is odd.

All other choices for D leave either B without a valid 7/8 or C on an even floor. Hence the only consistent assignment is:

- **A** – floor 6  
- **B** – floor 8  
- **C** – floor 7  
- **D** – floor 9  

All four clues are satisfied.
