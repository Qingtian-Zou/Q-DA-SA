There are 3 pieces in the image, and, according to the question, the numbers on each of the pieces should have the same sum.
Now, 1+2+3+...+12=78, so every piece's numbers should add up to 78/3=26.

Let's have a closer look at the pieces.
There are 3 pieces, and one of them has both the short and long hands.
(For short, this piece will be referred to as piece A.)
Piece A contains 4 numbers, which can be put in two continuous parts.
The other two pieces, piece B and piece C, also contain 4 numbers each, and all the 4 numbers are continuous.
Are there 4 continuous numbers from 1 to 12 that add up to 26?
Yes, 5+6+7+8=26!
These 4 numbers should be on either piece B or C.
However, there is not another set of such 4 numbers.
Wait, we are talking about a clock, so 12 and 1 can also be considered as "continuous" because they are adjacent on the clock!
11+12+1+2=26!
Other numbers left: 3+4+9+10=26!
Also, 3 and 4 are continuous, and 9 and 10 are continuous, so they are on piece A.
In conclusion, piece A has numbers [3, 4, 9, 10], and pieces B and C have numbers [5, 6, 7, 8] and [1, 2, 11, 12], though it is not clear which set is for piece B or C.

Now, if we can figure out how to place numbers [3, 4, 9, 10] on piece A, we will get the time.
Well, we know it is a clock, so the numbers should be increasing in the clockwise direction.
Keeping this in mind, there are two possible answers:
- The short hand is between 3 and 4 and is closer to 4, and the long hand is pointing to number 9. The time is 3:45.
- The short hand is between 9 and 10 and is closer to 10, and the long hand is pointing to number 3. The time is 9:15.

However, in the second case, if the time is 9:15, the short hand should be closer to 9, but not 10.
Therefore, the first case is the correct answer.

The time is 3:45.
