# Question

A teacher asks a student if he knows how to tell the time. The student nods, so the teacher presents him with the following puzzle:

"This wall clock fell down and broke into three pieces. You can't see the numbers from here, but I can tell you that the total of the numbers on each of the three pieces is the same. So, can you tell me what time this clock is showing?"
