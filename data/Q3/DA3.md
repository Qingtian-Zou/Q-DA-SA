# Thinking

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So we have four sisters: A, B, C, D. Each carries a total weight of 34 kilograms. Wait, hold on—the problem says "Each sister carries 34 kilograms in total." Hmm, but looking at the list they've already chosen:

- A has [16, 3] which sums to 19 kg
- B has [4, 2, 6] summing to 12 kg
- C has [12, 1] summing to 13 kg
- D has [11, 8] summing to 19 kg

Wait a second, that doesn't add up. Each sister is supposed to carry 34 kilograms total? But their current loads are way less. Hmm. Wait, maybe I misread.

Let me check again. The problem says: "Each sister carries 34 kilograms in total." Hmm, but the numbers given for each sister's pumpkins sum to less than that. Maybe there's a translation issue or typo here? Wait, no—the original problem might be translated from Chinese, so perhaps some nuances are lost.

Wait, looking at the problem statement: "The sisters have all chosen some pumpkins they plan to carry, as shown below." So each sister has selected some pumpkins already (the ones listed), and their total weight is part of the 34? Wait, no. Wait, maybe each sister carries a total of 34 kg across all pumpkins they take? But according to the given lists, A's pumpkins sum to 19 kg, so she has more pumpkins to carry as well?

Wait, here's the key: The problem says "Each sister carries 34 kilograms in total." So each of the four sisters must have a total weight of 34 kg. But right now they've chosen some pumpkins (the listed ones), and there are additional pumpkins not yet carried (the list given: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15). Wait, but the problem says "The weights of the pumpkins that have not yet been carried are: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15". So each sister has already chosen some pumpkins (the ones listed), and they need to choose more from the remaining ones so that each ends up with total 34 kg.

Wait, that seems plausible. Let me parse this again carefully:

"Each sister carries 34 kilograms in total." So final total per sister is 34 kg.

"The sisters have all chosen some pumpkins they plan to carry, as shown below." So the lists given (A: [16,3], etc.) are their already selected pumpkins. Then there are additional pumpkins not yet carried (the ones listed: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15), and we need to figure out how to distribute those among the sisters so that each sister's total becomes 34 kg.

Also, given conditions:

- A and C carry the same number of pumpkins

- B carries the most (pumpkins)

So, first step: calculate current totals for each sister.

A: 16 + 3 = 19 kg

B: 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 kg

C: 12 + 1 = 13 kg

D: 11 + 8 = 19 kg

So, the remaining pumpkins to be distributed are: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15 (total of seven pumpkins)

We need to add some of these to each sister so that:

A's total becomes 34 => needs 15 more kg

B's total becomes 34 => needs 22 more kg

C's total becomes 34 => needs 21 more kg

D's total becomes 34 => needs 15 more kg

Wait, hold on: 34 - current totals:

A: 34 - 19 = 15

B: 34 - 12 = 22

C: 34 - 13 = 21

D: 34 - 19 = 15

So each sister needs additional weights:

A: +15 kg

B: +22 kg

C: +21 kg

D: +15 kg

And the remaining pumpkins are seven in total, weights: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15.

We need to assign some of these numbers (each pumpkin can be assigned to one sister) so that:

- The sum added to A is exactly 15

- Sum added to B is exactly 22

- Sum added to C is exactly 21

- Sum added to D is exactly 15

Also, note that "A and C carry the same number of pumpkins" (i.e., after adding more pumpkins, A has same count as C)

And "B carries the most" (so B's total number of pumpkins is greater than each sister's)

Wait, but original counts:

A currently has 2 pumpkins

B: 3

C: 2

D: 2

So after adding more pumpkins:

Let’s denote x = number of additional pumpkins A takes

y = B's additional

z = C's additional

w = D's additional

Then, total pumpkins for each sister:

A: 2 + x

B: 3 + y

C: 2 + z

D: 2 + w

Given that A and C carry same number of pumpkins => (2 + x) = (2 + z) => x = z

Also, B carries the most => 3 + y > 2 + x, 3 + y > 2 + z, etc. Since x = z, it's equivalent to 3 + y > 2 + x.

Our goal is to assign subsets of {5,7,9,10,13,14,15} such that:

A gets a subset summing to 15 (with x elements)

C gets a subset summing to 21 (with z = x elements)

B gets a subset summing to 22 (with y elements)

D gets a subset summing to 15 (with w elements)

All subsets are disjoint, and cover all remaining pumpkins.

First, let's list the target sums:

A: 15

C: 21

B: 22

D: 15

Total of needed additions: 15 + 22 + 21 + 15 = 73. Let's check the sum of remaining pumpkins: 5+7+9+10+13+14+15.

Calculate that: 5+7=12, +9=21, +10=31, +13=44, +14=58, +15=73. Perfect, matches.

So all remaining pumpkins will be distributed exactly to the four sisters as required.

Now, let's focus on possible subsets.

Starting with A and D, both need 15 kg. Since they have the same number of pumpkins (x = w), we can find subsets for A and D each summing to 15 with the same cardinality.

Similarly, C needs 21 with z = x elements.

B needs 22 with y elements.

Let me list all possible subsets (with different sizes) that sum to 15, 21, etc., using the numbers {5,7,9,10,13,14,15}.

First, let's consider A and D both need subset sums of 15.

Possible subsets for 15:

Single pumpkin: only 15 (but 15 is in the list). So {15}

Two pumpkins: combinations that add to 15.

Check possible pairs:

5 + 10 = 15

7 + 8 but 8 not available

9 + 6 nope

So 5+10=15; 7+ something? 7+?=15 => 8 (not present). 9+6 invalid. So only {5,10}

Three pumpkins: 5+7+3 but 3 not there. Wait:

Looking for three numbers from the list that add to 15.

The smallest three numbers here are 5,7,9 which sum to 21 already. Wait, 5 + 7 + 3 invalid. Wait, 5,7,9: too big.

Wait, hold on: remaining pumpkins are [5,7,9,10,13,14,15]. All the numbers here are >=5.

So three smallest numbers: 5+7+9=21 >15. Therefore, impossible to have a subset of size 3 or more that sums to 15. So subsets for A and D must be size 1 or 2.

Similarly, check:

Size 1: {15}

Size 2: {5,10}, {7,8} invalid, {9,6} invalid, so only {5,10}

Wait, is there another pair?

Check 5 + 10 =15

7 + (something) =15? 7+8=15 but 8 not present.

Similarly, 9 +6 nope. So yes, only two subsets: single [15] and double [5,10]

So A and D each must have either one pumpkin (15) or two pumpkins (5 and 10). But since they need same number of pumpkins, possibilities:

Case 1: Both A and D take 1 pumpkin each. Then they would both take {15}, but there's only one 15. So impossible.

Therefore, Case 2: Both take two pumpkins each. Then we have to assign {5,10} to both? Wait no, since they are different sisters, but the subsets must be disjoint.

Wait, if A takes [5,10] (sum 15), then D would need another subset of size 2 summing to 15, which only exists as [5,10], but that's overlapping. So no, this is a problem.

Wait, hold on: Wait, in the remaining pumpkins list, there are seven numbers: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15. Only one of each weight. So each pumpkin is unique.

So if A takes {5,10}, then D cannot take another subset that sums to 15 with two elements unless it's a different pair, but there isn't another pair. Wait:

Wait, let's re-examine possible subsets for 15.

Size 2:

Possible pairs:

5 and 10 (sum 15)

Is there any other? Let's see:

7 + ? =15 => 8 not present

9 + ?=15 =>6 not present

So only {5,10} for size 2.

Size 1: {15}

Therefore, the possible subsets are either {15} (size 1) or {5,10} (size 2). Since A and D must have same number of pumpkins, they both take size 1 or both size 2.

But if they both take size 1, they both need to take {15}, which is impossible as only one pumpkin of 15 exists. Therefore, the only possibility is that both A and D take two pumpkins each: {5,10} each? But again, the pumpkins are unique. So A takes {5,10}, but then D cannot take another {5,10}. Hmm, so this suggests a contradiction?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, hold on: Wait, is 15 considered as one pumpkin or multiple? The problem states "each number indicates how heavy the carried pumpkin is". So each pumpkin has a unique weight in the list given for remaining pumpkins. So yes, each pumpkin is distinct and only one exists of each weight.

Therefore, since both A and D need to get subsets summing to 15 with same cardinality:

If they each take size 2: then we would need two different pairs each summing to 15. But as established, there's only one pair {5,10}. So impossible.

If they each take size 1: needs two pumpkins of weight 15, which doesn't exist.

Wait a minute, this is a problem. Which suggests that maybe my initial calculation is wrong?

Wait, let's double-check the total needed per sister.

The problem says: "Each sister carries 34 kilograms in total."

But according to their current loads:

A: [16,3] = 19 kg

B: [4,2,6] =12 kg

C: [12,1] =13 kg

D: [11,8] =19 kg

So each needs to reach 34. So:

A needs 15 more

B needs 22

C needs 21

D needs 15

But according to the remaining pumpkins summing to 73, which matches.

Wait, but the problem says "the rest of pumpkins get shared out". Hmm.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem statement. Let me check again.

"The weights of the pumpkins that have not yet been carried are: 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15"

So seven pumpkins left. Each sister needs to add some of these.

But according to our previous calculation, A and D need 15 each.

Wait, but if there's no way for both A and D to get subsets summing to 15 with same number of elements, then either the problem is flawed or my reasoning is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe "Each sister carries 34 kilograms in total" refers to all pumpkins they carry (the ones listed plus others), but perhaps the initial lists are not the only ones? Wait, no, problem says "The sisters have all chosen some pumpkins they plan to carry, as shown below."

Wait, another thought: Maybe "Each sister carries 34 kilograms in total" is a mistranslation or misunderstanding. Perhaps it's that together they carry 34 kg? But that seems unlikely.

Wait, looking back at the original problem statement (translated):

"Four sisters are taking the pumpkins they have grown to the market in the village. Each pumpkin weighs between one and 16 kilograms. Each sister carries 34 kilograms in total."

Ah! Wait a second: "Each sister carries 34 kilograms in total". So each individual sister's total is 34 kg.

But given that, as we saw, A currently has 19, needs 15 more; same for D. But then the issue remains.

Wait, unless... Maybe the problem means that collectively they carry 34 kg? But it says "each sister carries 34 kilograms", so per sister.

Hmm. Given that the math checks out on total remaining pumpkins summing to 73 (which is exactly 15+22+21+15), so our initial calculation seems right.

So, back to the problem: A and D both need subsets summing to 15 with same size. But according to above, it's impossible? Unless...

Wait, hold on: Wait, pumpkin weights are between 1-16 kg. The remaining pumpkins are given as 5,7,9,10,13,14,15—all within that range.

Is there a subset of size 3 for A or D?

Wait earlier I thought three smallest numbers sum to 21: 5 +7 +9=21. Which is over 15. So no subset of size 3 can sum to 15. Similarly, subsets larger than 2 are impossible.

Wait, unless... Wait, if a sister takes more than one pumpkin but the weights add up. Wait, for example, A needs 15. If there was a pumpkin of weight 7 and another of 8, but nope.

Wait, given only remaining pumpkins: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15.

So possible subsets summing to 15:

- [15]

- [5,10]

That's it.

Similarly for D. So if A takes [15], then D has to take another subset of size 1: but only [15] is available, which is taken. Alternatively, if they both take two pumpkins, but there's only one pair.

This seems like a dead end. Wait, unless...

Wait, hold on! The problem says "A and C carry the same number of pumpkins". Maybe it refers to the total number of pumpkins each sister has carried overall (original + additional), not just the additional ones? But according to problem statement: "the rest of pumpkins get shared out", so we're dealing with additions.

Wait, original counts:

A: 2

B:3

C:2

D:2

After adding x,y,z,w respectively:

A:2+x

C:2+z

Given A and C carry same number => 2 +x = 2 +z => x=z. So additional pumpkins for A and C must be equal in count.

But perhaps my earlier analysis is missing something.

Wait, let's consider that maybe one of the sisters (B or D) could have a different subset.

Alternatively, let's look at sister C needing 21 kg with z elements, where z = x (same as A's additional pumpkins).

Let's see possible subsets for C summing to 21:

Possible combinations:

Check single pumpkin: 21 not in list (remaining pumpkins up to 15), so no.

Two pumpkins:

Looking for pairs that add to 21.

Check:

5 +16 (nope)

7 +14=21

9 +12 (but 12 is already carried by C, not remaining)

Wait remaining pumpkins are [5,7,9,10,13,14,15]

So pairs:

5 + 16 invalid

7 +14 =21 ✔️

9 +12 invalid

10 +11 invalid (D has 11 already carried)

Wait, remaining pumpkins: 7 and 14 sum to 21.

Similarly, 13 +8 invalid. Wait:

Wait:

7 +14=21

Also, 5 + 16 nope; 9 +12 nope; 10 +11 nope.

How about three pumpkins?

Check combinations of three:

Smallest: 5+7+9=21. Hey, that's exactly 21!

Wow, okay:

5 +7 +9 =21

That's a subset of size 3 summing to 21.

Any others?

Let's see:

5 +7 +10=22

5 +7 +13=25

Too big.

How about:

5 + something else:

Wait, another triplet: ?

5 + 9 +7 = same as above.

What about 5 + 10 +6? No. Not helpful.

Another triplet: 7 + 9 +5 =21 (same)

Is there a different triplet?

Check:

How about 5 + 13 + 3? No.

Wait, seems like only {5,7,9} sums to 21 with three elements.

Any two-element subsets for C?

We have {7,14}=21

Also {5, ?}: 21 -5=16 not present. 21-7=14 (as above). 21-9=12 not present. So only {7,14} as two-element subset.

What about four elements? Probably too big since smallest four: 5+7+9+10=31>21. Not possible.

So C can either have a two-pumpkin subset {7,14} or three-pumpkin subset {5,7,9}

Similarly, let's think about this.

If C takes {7,14}, that's size 2.

Or C takes {5,7,9}, size 3.

Given that A and C must have same number of additional pumpkins (x = z), so if C has z=2 or 3, then A also needs x=2 or 3.

But previously we thought A can only have subsets of size 1 or 2 for sum 15. But wait: Wait, A's required additional sum is 15.

If A takes three pumpkins... Wait, earlier I thought minimal sum for three pumpkins is 5+7+9=21>15, which is true. So no subset of size >=3 can sum to 15. Therefore, A must have size 1 or 2.

But C has z = x, so if C takes z=2 (the {7,14}), then A must take x=2 ({5,10})

If C takes z=3 ({5,7,9}), then A would need to take x=3 pumpkins summing to 15—but impossible as minimal is 21. So only possible case: C takes two pumpkins {7,14}, and A takes two pumpkins {5,10}

That seems promising.

Let's explore this path.

So:

Case: C takes [7,14] (sum 21, size 2)

Therefore, z = 2, so A must take x=2 pumpkins summing to 15. As established, only possible subset is {5,10}

So assign:

A gets additional {5,10} => total A: 19 +15=34

D needs also to get sum 15 with same number of pumpkins as A (x=2), so D must also take a pair summing to 15. But only {5,10} exists for that. But we already assigned {5,10} to A, so conflict.

Ah, problem here.

Wait, unless... Wait, in this case, if C takes [7,14], then:

Used pumpkins: 7,14

Leftover remaining pumpkins: 5,9,10,13,15 (since original remaining were seven; removed two)

A needs {5,10} sum 15.

Then D also needs a subset of size 2 summing to 15. But the remaining pumpkins after A and C would be: After removing 7,14, then 5,10 for A: left with 9,13,15

Wait, wait:

Total remaining pumpkins initially: [5,7,9,10,13,14,15]

Case where C takes {7,14}, so remove those.

Left: [5,9,10,13,15]

A needs to take a pair summing to 15: only {5,10}

So assign A: {5,10}; remaining pumpkins now: [9,13,15]

Then D needs a subset of size 2 (since x=z=2) that sums to 15. But remaining are 9,13,15—all too big. 9+? =15? 6 not there. So impossible.

Hmm. Dead end here.

Alternative idea: What if C takes the three-pumpkin subset {5,7,9}? Sum=21.

Then z=3 (additional pumpkins for C), so A must also take x=3 pumpkins summing to 15. But as established earlier, minimal sum of three pumpkins is 5+7+9=21>15, impossible. So this case invalid.

So both possibilities for C lead to contradictions? That can't be.

Wait, maybe there's another subset for C?

Let me think again about subsets summing to 21.

We had {5,7,9}=21 and {7,14}=21.

Any others?

Check:

How about {13, something}? 21 -13=8 not present.

{10 + x + y} =21. 10+? Let's see: 10 +7 +4 nope; 10 +5 +6 nope.

Wait:

Wait another pair: {9,12} but 12 is already carried by C (the list for C is [12,1], so 12 is not a remaining pumpkin). The remaining pumpkins don't have 12.

Hmm.

Wait, what about three-element subsets other than {5,7,9}? Let's check:

{5, 9, 7} same as above.

{5, 10, 6} invalid.

How about {13, 5, 3}? No.

Not really. Seems like only two subsets for C: size 2 ({7,14}) and size 3 ({5,7,9})

Wait, here's another thought: Could D be taking a different subset? Wait, in the previous case where C takes {7,14}, A takes {5,10}, then remaining pumpkins are [9,13,15]. Now B needs 22 kg.

Wait, let's try to see:

After assigning A: {5,10}; C:{7,14}

Remaining pumpkins: 9,13,15

Total needed by B:22; D:15.

Wait, but we have only three pumpkins left. But D needs sum 15. Possible?

Check:

D could take {15} (sum 15), then remaining pumpkin weights 9 and 13 for B. But 9+13=22. Perfect!

Wait, hold on! This might work.

Let me retrace:

Case: C takes {7,14} (size 2)

A takes {5,10} (size 2), so x=z=2 as required.

Now used pumpkins: A={5,10}, C={7,14}

Remaining pumpkins: [9,13,15]

B needs 22 kg; D needs 15 kg.

If D takes {15} (size 1), but wait: A and C each took size 2, so D's additional count w should equal x=2? Wait no!

Wait, hold on! Critical mistake here.

The problem states: "A and C carry the same number of pumpkins". This refers to total pumpkins each carries (original + additional). But in our analysis earlier, we considered x and z as additional counts. However, the problem says: "A and C carry the same number of pumpkins"—probably meaning overall.

Wait, this is probably where I messed up.

Let me clarify:

The problem says: "A and C carry the same number of pumpkins"

So total pumpkins carried by A = total pumpkins carried by C

A currently carries 2, so if she gets x additional, total=2+x

C currently carries 2, gets z additional, total=2+z

Thus, 2 +x = 2 +z ⇒ x=z. So my original reasoning was correct.

But in the current scenario:

If we have assigned A: {5,10} (x=2), C:{7,14} (z=2). Then A and C both carry 4 pumpkins total—same number. Good.

D's total pumpkins = original 2 + w (w additional)

B's total pumpkins = original 3 + y

Given B carries the most ⇒ 3 + y > all others.

In this case:

If we assign D: {15} (so w=1), then D's total pumpkins =3. A and C have 4 each, so B must carry more than 4.

B needs to take remaining pumpkins: [9,13]

Wait, but if D takes {15}, sum=15 (exactly what she needs). Then remaining pumpkin weights: 9 and 13.

B needs total additional weight of 22. So 9 +13 =22. Perfect!

So B gets both 9 and 13. y=2 additional pumpkins.

Check totals:

A's total: 19 +5+10=34, with 2 (original) +2=4 pumpkins

B's total:12 +9+13=34, with 3 original +2=5 pumpkins

C's total:13 +7+14=34, with 2 +2=4 pumpkins

D's total:19 +15=34, with 2 +1=3 pumpkins

Check conditions:

- A and C carry same number of pumpkins (both 4). Good.

- B carries the most (5 pumpkins > others' 4,4,3). Good.

All remaining pumpkins assigned: {5,7,9,10,13,14,15}

A: [5,10]

C: [7,14]

B: [9,13]

D: [15]

Wait, but hold on—does D carry the same number? No problem.

But let's verify all:

Check if all pumpkins are assigned:

Used in assignments:

A:5,10

C:7,14

B:9,13

D:15

Remaining list was [5,7,9,10,13,14,15]. Yes, all accounted for.

Check sums:

A adds 15 ✔️

C adds 21 ✔️ (7+14=21)

B adds 22 (9+13=22) ✔️

D adds 15 (15) ✔️

Number of pumpkins per sister:

A: original 2 +2 =4

B: original 3 +2 =5

C: original 2 +2 =4

D: original 2 +1 =3

So B has the most (5), A and C have same (4). All conditions satisfied.

Wait, this works!

But earlier I thought there was a problem with D having different number of pumpkins than A/C. But according to this solution:

- A and C each carry 4 pumpkins total

- D carries 3

So it's okay because the condition is only that A and C have same number; B has more.

Yes, this fits all constraints.

But in my initial analysis I missed that D could take a single pumpkin (15), which gives her different count than A/C—but the problem doesn't require D to match anyone else. The key is A=C counts are same, B most.

So this solution works.

Let me confirm again:

Sister A's total pumpkins: [16,3] + [5,10] → four pumpkins total (16,3,5,10), sum 34

B's: [4,2,6] + [9,13] → five pumpkins (4,2,6,9,13), sum 34

C's: [12,1] + [7,14] → four pumpkins (12,1,7,14), sum 34

D's: [11,8] + [15] → three pumpkins (11,8,15), sum 34

Check all sums:

A:16+3+5+10=34 ✔️

B:4+2+6+9+13=34 ✔️ (4+2+6=12; 9+13=22 → total 34)

C:12+1+7+14=34 ✔️ (12+1=13; 7+14=21 → total 34)

D:11+8+15=34 ✔️

Number of pumpkins:

A:4, B:5, C:4, D:3. So A and C same, B most.

Remaining pumpkins assigned completely.

This seems perfect.

But wait, the problem says "the rest of pumpkins get shared out". The answer would be assigning:

A gets 5 and 10

B gets 9 and 13

C gets 7 and 14

D gets 15

But let me check if there are other possibilities.

Alternative: Could D take two pumpkins?

Wait, in the above solution it works. Let's see if another solution exists.

Suppose instead C takes {5,7,9} summing to 21 (z=3), then A would need x=3 pumpkins summing to 15—but impossible as minimal sum is 21. So no.

Another idea: What if B takes a single pumpkin? Needs 22 kg. The largest remaining pumpkin is 15, so even 15 alone isn't enough. Next, 14 + something=22 ⇒ 8 not present. Not feasible. So B must take multiple pumpkins.

In the solution we found, B takes two pumpkins (9 and 13). Is there another way?

Suppose after assigning:

If C took {7,14}, A took {5,10}, remaining [9,13,15]

Alternative assignment: D takes {something else}? But D needs exactly 15. The only possibility is {15} or {5,10} (already taken). So no.

Alternatively, if we tried another approach:

Suppose A takes {15}, size=1

Then to satisfy x=z, C must also take size=1 subset summing to21—but there's no single pumpkin of 21. Impossible.

So only feasible solution is the one we found.

Therefore, the answer should be:

A gets 5 and 10

B gets 9 and 13

C gets 7 and 14

D gets 15

Let me just confirm all numbers are used once.

Remaining pumpkins:5,7,9,10,13,14,15

Assigned:

A:5,10

B:9,13

C:7,14

D:15

Yes, all seven accounted for.

This must be the solution.

**Final Answer**
A gets \boxed{[5, 10]}, B gets \boxed{[9, 13]}, C gets \boxed{[7, 14]}, and D gets \boxed{[15]}.

# Answer

To determine how the remaining pumpkins should be shared out so that **each sister carries exactly 34 kilograms** in total, we begin by analyzing the current pumpkin loads and the remaining pumpkins.

---

### 🔍 Step 1: Understand Current Loads

Each sister has already selected some pumpkins:

- **A**: [16, 3] → 19 kg
- **B**: [4, 2, 6] → 12 kg
- **C**: [12, 1] → 13 kg
- **D**: [11, 8] → 19 kg

Each sister must carry a **total of 34 kg**, so the additional weight needed is:

- **A**: 34 − 19 = **15 kg**
- **B**: 34 − 12 = **22 kg**
- **C**: 34 − 13 = **21 kg**
- **D**: 34 − 19 = **15 kg**

The remaining pumpkins (not yet carried) are:

> [**5**, **7**, **9**, **10**, **13**, **14**, **15**]  
Total weight: **73 kg** → matches the required total of 15 + 22 + 21 + 15 = **73 kg**

So, all remaining pumpkins will be distributed.

### 🧠 Step 2: Apply Constraints

We are given two key constraints:

1. **A and C carry the same number of pumpkins** (in total)
2. **B carries the most** (i.e., more than A, C, or D)

Let’s denote:
- $ x $ = additional pumpkins for A
- $ z $ = additional pumpkins for C

From constraint 1:  
$$
x = z \quad \text{(since total pumpkins per sister = original + additional)}
$$

Also, B must have more pumpkins than all others.

### ✅ Step 3: Try a Valid Assignment

Let’s explore a consistent assignment that satisfies **all constraints**:

| Sister | Current (kg) | Additional (kg) | Total (kg) | Additional Pumpkins |
|--------|----------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| A      | 19              | [5, 10] → 15        | **34**           | 2                     |
| B      | 12              | [9, 13] → 22        | **34**           | 2                     |
| C      | 13              | [7, 14] → 21        | **34**           | 2                     |
| D      | 19              | [15] → 15           | **34**           | 1                     |

#### ✅ Check Constraints:

- **A and C carry the same number of pumpkins**: A has 2 additional, C has 2 additional → total pumpkins = 4 each ✔️
- **B carries the most**: B has 2 additional pumpkins (total of 5) > A and C (4), D (3) ✔️
- All remaining pumpkins used exactly once: [5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15] → all accounted for ✔️
- Each sister's total weight = 34 kg ✔️

This assignment satisfies **all conditions**.

### 📌 Final Answer

The remaining pumpkins are distributed as follows:

- **A gets**: \boxed{[5, 10]}
- **B gets**: \boxed{[9, 13]}
- **C gets**: \boxed{[7, 14]}
- **D gets**: \boxed{[15]}
