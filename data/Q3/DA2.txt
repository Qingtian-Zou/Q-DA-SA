[Thinking]
We need to partition remaining pumpkins among A,B,C,D such that each carries total weight 34 kg. Current sums: A has 16+3=19; B has 4+2+6=12; C has 12+1=13; D has 11+8=19. Need to add weights from list [5,7,9,10,13,14,15] to each such that totals become 34.

Let’s denote remaining weights: R = {5,7,9,10,13,14,15} sum = 5+7+9+10+13+14+15 = 73. Total needed to bring everyone to 34: Each sister needs additional weight:

A: need 34-19=15
B: need 22
C: need 21
D: need 15

Check sums: 15+22+21+15 = 73 matches.

We must assign weights accordingly. Also constraints: A and C carry same number of pumpkins. Currently A has 2 pumpkins, C has 2 pumpkins. So they must both get equal count added. B carries the most pumpkins (so B will have more pumpkins than others). Let's denote number of additional pumpkins each gets: let a,b,c,d counts. Need a=c, and b > a, b > c, b> d? Actually "B carries the most" implies B has strictly more pumpkins than any other sister. So b > a = c, and also b > d.

Total pumpkins: existing 2+3+2+2=9; plus remaining 7 =16 pumpkins total. After distribution, total counts: A: 2+a, B: 3+b, C: 2+c, D: 2+d. Sum 2+a +3+b+2+c+2+d = 9 + (a+b+c+d) = 16 => a+b+c+d=7.

We know a=c. So let a=c=x. Then b + d + 2x = 7. Also b > x and b > d, and also presumably all nonnegative integers.

Also weight sums: A needs 15 weight from remaining; B needs 22; C needs 21; D needs 15. And counts of weights assigned to each must match the number of pumpkins they get (i.e., a items for A etc). So we need to partition R into subsets A',B',C',D' with sums 15,22,21,15 respectively and sizes x,x,b,d.

Also B must carry most pumpkins: b > x and b > d. And also since B already had 3 pumpkins; others have 2 each. So B will definitely have more than them if b >=1? Actually if a=0, then C would also 0; but A and C have same number. But they currently have 2 pumpkins each. They could get zero additional? If x=0, they'd stay at 2 pumpkins. B must carry the most: B has 3 + b > 2? If b>=1, B will have at least 4 >2. So possible.

But also A and C cannot exceed some limit? Not specified. We just need to find a valid distribution.

We can brute force search mentally or systematically.

Let's list remaining weights sorted: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15

Goal subsets sums:

Two subsets sum 15 each (A' and D') because A needs 15 and D needs 15.
One subset sum 22 (B')
One subset sum 21 (C')
But note that A and C need same number of pumpkins. But they have different target weights: A=15, C=21. So their counts may differ in weight but must be equal in count.

Also B needs 22 weight; D needs 15 weight.

We also consider counts.

Let's find all subsets of remaining weights summing to 15:

Possible combos:

5+10 = 15
7+8? no 8 not present.
9+6? 6 not present.
13+2? no 2 not present.
14+1? no 1.
15 alone.
So options: {5,10}, {15}. Also could be 5+7+3? 3 not present. So only two combos.

Similarly subsets sum to 21:

Possible combos:

5+16? no 16.
7+14 = 21
9+12? no 12 present in R? No.
10+11? 11 not present.
13+8? 8 not present.
15+6? 6 not present.
5+7+9=21 (since 5+7+9 =21)
5+16? no.
Also 5+7+9 is a triple. And maybe 10+... etc none else.

So options for sum 21: {7,14}, {5,7,9}.

Subsets sum to 22:

Options:

5+17? no.
7+15=22
9+13 =22
10+12? 12 not present.
14+8? 8 not present.
15+... 7 already used maybe duplicate.
Also could be 5+7+10=22 (5+7+10=22). Also 5+9+8? no. 7+9+6? no. 10+... etc.

Also 13+9 =22 as above. And 15+5+2? no.

So options: {7,15}, {9,13}, {5,7,10}. Also maybe 5+14+3? no.

Subsets sum to 15 again for D': same as A' combos: {5,10} or {15}.

Now we need to partition all seven weights among these four subsets without overlap. Let's try combinations.

Case 1: Use singleton 15 for one of the 15-sum groups (A' or D'). Then remaining weights are 5,7,9,10,13,14. Need to split into other three subsets with sums 15,21,22 accordingly.

Remaining weights sum = 73-15=58. We need 15+21+22=58 correct.

Now we have 6 weights left: 5,7,9,10,13,14.

We need to assign them such that one subset is 15 (remaining for other 15-sum group). Options: {5,10} or maybe {7,8}? no. So likely {5,10}. Then we use those two. Remaining weights: 7,9,13,14 sum =43. Need to split into 21 and 22.

Possible combos: For 21: options with these remaining: {7,14} gives 21. Leaves 9,13 sum=22. Perfect! That works.

Thus assignment:

D' (or A') gets 15 alone.
The other 15-sum group gets {5,10}.
21-sum group gets {7,14}
22-sum group gets {9,13}
Now we need to decide which sister gets which subset consistent with counts.

We have two 15-sum groups: one singleton (size1), other pair (size2). A and C must have same number of pumpkins added. So we need to assign the subsets such that the counts for A and C are equal. Let's denote sizes:

Singleton 15 group size=1
Pair {5,10} size=2
Group {7,14} size=2
Group {9,13} size=2
Now counts needed: For each sister, added pumpkins count a,c,b,d.

We have four subsets; we need to assign them to A,B,C,D. We must satisfy:

A needs 15 weight. Could be singleton or pair? Wait both A and D require 15 weight. So A gets one of the 15-sum subsets; D gets the other. There are two options: either A gets {5,10} (size2) and D gets {15} (size1), or vice versa.

C needs 21 weight => must get {7,14} (size2). Good.

B needs 22 weight => must get {9,13} (size2).

Now counts:

Case I: A gets {5,10} size2; D gets {15} size1. Then a=2, d=1. C gets {7,14} size2 so c=2. B gets {9,13} size2 so b=2.

Check constraints: a=c=2 good. B has 2 pumpkins added but B already had 3; others have 2 each? Wait A and D would have total pumpkins: A currently had 2 + a(2) =4 pumpkins; C had 2+ c(2)=4; D had 2+ d(1)=3. B had 3+ b(2)=5 pumpkins. So B indeed carries the most (5 > 4 > 3). Good.

Case II: A gets {15} size1; D gets {5,10} size2. Then a=1,d=2. C still gets size2. B size2. Then counts: a=1,c=2 not equal => violates A and C same number of pumpkins. So case I is valid.

Thus distribution:

A carries [16,3] + [5,10] = [16,3,5,10]
B carries [4,2,6] + [9,13] = [4,2,6,9,13]
C carries [12,1] + [7,14] = [12,1,7,14]
D carries [11,8] + [15] = [11,8,15]
Check totals: A: 16+3+5+10=34. B:4+2+6+9+13=34. C:12+1+7+14=34. D:11+8+15=34.

All conditions satisfied.

Thus answer.

[Answer]
The pumpkins that are still to be carried are

5
,
  
7
,
  
9
,
  
10
,
  
13
,
  
14
,
  
15
5,7,9,10,13,14,15

Their total weight is 
73
73 kg, which is exactly the amount needed for all four sisters (they each need 34 kg and already carry a total of 
9
+
73
=
82
9+73=82 kg).

Step 1 – How much must each sister add?
Sister	current weight	weight still needed
A	16 + 3 = 19	34 – 19 = 15 kg
B	4 + 2 + 6 = 12	34 – 12 = 22 kg
C	12 + 1 = 13	34 – 13 = 21 kg
D	11 + 8 = 19	34 – 19 = 15 kg
So we must split the remaining pumpkins into four groups whose weights are

15
,
  
22
,
  
21
,
  
15
15,22,21,15 kg.

Step 2 – Find suitable weight combinations
From the seven numbers, the only ways to obtain each of these sums are:

15 kg: either 
{
5
,
10
}
{5,10} or 
{
15
}
{15}
22 kg: either 
{
7
,
15
}
{7,15}, 
{
9
,
13
}
{9,13} or 
{
5
,
7
,
10
}
{5,7,10}
21 kg: either 
{
7
,
14
}
{7,14} or 
{
5
,
7
,
9
}
{5,7,9}
A quick check shows that the following partition works:

Weight	Group (sum)	Pumpkin set
15	15 kg	
{
15
}
{15}
15	15 kg	
{
5
,
10
}
{5,10}
22	22 kg	
{
9
,
13
}
{9,13}
21	21 kg	
{
7
,
14
}
{7,14}
These four groups use all seven remaining pumpkins and satisfy the required sums.

Step 3 – Assign to sisters while respecting the rules
A must receive a 15‑kg group.

If A takes 
{
5
,
10
}
{5,10} it gets two more pumpkins; D would then take 
{
15
}
{15} (one pumpkin).

C needs 21 kg and therefore gets 
{
7
,
14
}
{7,14}, which is two pumpkins.

B must carry the most pumpkins.

With the above choices B receives 
{
9
,
13
}
{9,13}, i.e. two pumpkins – exactly as many as C but more than D (who has only one).

Thus:

Sister	Original pumpkins	New pumpkins	Total weight
A	
16
,
  
3
16,3	
5
,
  
10
5,10	
34
34 kg
B	
4
,
  
2
,
  
6
4,2,6	
9
,
  
13
9,13	
34
34 kg
C	
12
,
  
1
12,1	
7
,
  
14
7,14	
34
34 kg
D	
11
,
  
8
11,8	
15
15	
34
34 kg
Check the conditions:

Each sister carries exactly 34 kg.
A and C carry the same number of pumpkins (4 each).
B carries more pumpkins than anyone else (5 vs. 4, 4, 3).
All constraints are satisfied.

Answer

A : [16, 3] + [5,10]   → 34 kg
B : [4, 2, 6] + [9,13] → 34 kg
C : [12,1] + [7,14]    → 34 kg
D : [11,8] + [15]      → 34 kg
These are the only possible assignments that meet every requirement.
