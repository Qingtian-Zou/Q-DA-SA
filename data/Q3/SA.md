It is said that each sister carries the same weight of pumpkins, 34 kilograms. Let's first calculate how many kilograms each sister needs to further carry:

- A: 34 - 16 - 3 = 15
- B: 34 - 4 - 2 - 6 = 22
- C: 34 - 12 - 1 = 21
- D: 34 - 11 - 8 = 15

A and C carry the same number of pumpkins. Since they currently carry the same number of pumpkins, they also need to further pick the same number of pumpkins. However, according the results above, their weights are different. Also, note that there is only 1 pumpkin that weighs 15 kilograms to be picked up. All the rest available pumpkins weigh below 15 kilograms. This means that, if A picks the pumpkin that weighs 15 kilograms, there is no pumpkin that weighs 21 kilograms for C to pick up. It can also be inferred that any 3 or more of the available pumpkins weigh more than 15 kilograms. Therefore, A and C further pick 2 pumpkins. Now, the only two pumpkins whose weights add up to 15 kilograms is the two that weigh 5 and 10 kilograms. These two are for A, which means A carries [16, 3, 5, 10]. Similarly, the only two pumpkins whose weights add up to 21 kilograms is the two that weigh 7 and 14 kilograms. These two are for C, which means C carries [12, 1, 7, 14].

Now A and C have got their pumpkins, pumpkins that weigh 9, 13, and 15 kilograms are still available. The rest is easy. B needs 22 kilograms, and 9 + 13 = 22. Therefore, B carries [4, 2, 6, 9, 13]. The last one is for D, which means D carries [11, 8, 15].

Finally, the only condition that has not been examined is that B carries the most. Let's see how many pumpkins each sister carries: A carries 4, B carries 5, C carries 4, and D carries 3. This condition is met.

Therefore, the final distribution of pumpkins is:
- A: [16, 3, 5, 10]
- B: [4, 2, 6, 9, 13]
- C: [12, 1, 7, 14]
- D: [11, 8, 15]
