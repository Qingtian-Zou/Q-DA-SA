[Thinking]
We need to distribute remaining pumpkins among A,B,C,D so each total 34, constraints: A and C carry same number of pumpkins. B carries most pumpkins (count). We have current counts: A has2, B3, C2, D2. Remaining pumpkins weights sum:5+7+9+10+13+14+15=73. Total needed to reach 34 each: need add per sister: A needs 18, B needs 20, C needs 22, D needs 23. Sum needed 83 but remaining is73 so something off? Wait total weights carried currently: A16+3=19; B4+2+6=12; C12+1=13; D11+8=19 sum=63. Total all pumpkins weigh 63+73=136. Each sister 34*4=136 correct.

Need distribute remaining to reach totals. Let x_i be added weights to each. A needs 15? wait 34-19=15 not 18. compute: A:34-19=15; B:34-12=22; C:34-13=21; D:34-19=15. Sum needed =73 correct.

Now need counts: current counts: A2, B3, C2, D2. Need final equal number for A and C? same number of pumpkins. Also B carries most pumpkins. Let add kA,kB,kC,kD pumpkins respectively from remaining set (7 pumpkins). So total added counts sum 7.

Let nA=2+kA, nB=3+kB, nC=2+kC, nD=2+kD. Constraints: nA=nC; B has most so nB > others. Also all integer >=0.

We need to assign weights accordingly.

Try possibilities. Since A and C same count, and currently 2 each. So kA=kC. Let t =kA. Then nA=nC=2+t. nB=3+kB; nD=2+kD.

Since B most: 3+kB > 2+t and >2+kD. Also sum of k's =7 => 2t + kB + kD =7.

Also weight sums: A needs15, C needs21, B22, D15.

We need to find assignment.

Try t=1 then kA=kC=1 each added one pumpkin. Then remaining counts: nA=nC=3. Need B >3 so 3+kB >=4 => kB>=1. Also nD=2+kD <=3? could be equal but B must be most strictly? "most" implies strictly more than others. So nD < nB. For t=1, sum equation:2*1 +kB +kD =7 => kB + kD =5. Since kB>=1 and kD >=0.

Also weight constraints: A needs15 with 1 pumpkin; so that pumpkin must be 15? but 15 in remaining set yes. So assign 15 to A. Then C needs21 with one pumpkin; only remaining weights after assigning 15: {5,7,9,10,13,14}. Need one weight 21 impossible. So t=1 invalid.

t=2: then kA=kC=2 each added two pumpkins. nA=nC=4. B must >4 so kB>=2 (since 3+2=5). Sum equation:2*2 +kB +kD =7 => kB + kD =3. With kB >=2, possibilities: kB=2,kD=1 or kB=3,kD=0.

Weight sums: A needs15 with two pumpkins sum to15; possible combos from remaining set? we haven't assigned yet. C needs21 with two pumpkins sum 21.

Try find assignment of weights satisfying all.

Remaining weights 5,7,9,10,13,14,15.

We need choose two for A summing15: possibilities (1) 5+10=15; (2) 6? not available; (3) 7+8 no. So only 5 and10 for A.

Then remaining after assigning to A: {7,9,13,14,15}. C needs two pumpkins sum21: options: 7+14=21 or 9+12 but 12 used; so 7 and14 must go to C.

Remaining now: {9,13,15}. B needs22 with kB pumpkins. D needs15 with kD pumpkins.

Case1: kB=2,kD=1. Then B takes two pumpkins sum22 from remaining {9,13,15}. Possible combos: 9+13=22 fits. So B gets 9 and13. D gets remaining 15 weight; but D needs15 weight, good. Check counts: A had 4 pumpkins (2+2), C also 4, B has 3+2=5, D 2+1=3. B most yes. Works.

Thus distribution:
A: [16,3,5,10]
C:[12,1,7,14]
B:[4,2,6,9,13]
D:[11,8,15]

All sums correct.

A	16 , 3	19
B	4 , 2 , 6	12
C	12 , 1	13
D	11 , 8	19

Each sister must carry 34 kg in total, so the missing weights for each sister are

34−19=15 kg

2. Trying possible values of

t
=

t=1 – A and C would each get one extra pumpkin.

Then B must have at least two more pumpkins, but the required weights cannot be matched (A needs a single‑pumpkin weight 15, while C would need a single‑pumpkin weight 21 which does not exist).

→ Impossible

t=2 – A and C each get two extra pumpkins.

The weight constraints then give a unique workable assignment (see below).

Step‑by‑step

A needs two pumpkins summing to 15.

Only possible pair from the remaining set: 
5
+
10
=
15
5+10=15.

Assign 5 kg and 10 kg to A.

C needs two pumpkins summing to 21.

Remaining weights after giving to A are 
{
7
,
9
,
13
,
14
,
15
}
{7,9,13,14,15}.

Only pair that works: 
7
+
14
=
21
7+14=21.

Assign 7 kg and 14 kg to C.

After these assignments the remaining pumpkins are 
{
9
,
13
,
15
}
{9,13,15}.

B needs two pumpkins totaling 22.

The only pair that works: 
9
+
13
=
22
9+13=22.

Assign 9 kg and 13 kg to B.

D receives the last remaining pumpkin, weight 15 kg.

4. Final distribution
Sister	Pumpkins (kg)	Total weight
A	16 , 3 , 5 , 10	34 kg
B	4 , 2 , 6 , 9 , 13	34 kg
C	12 , 1 , 7 , 14	34 kg
D	11 , 8 , 15	34 kg
A and C each carry 4 pumpkins.
B carries the most with 5 pumpkins.
Every sister’s total weight is exactly 34 kg.
Thus the remaining pumpkins are shared as shown above.
