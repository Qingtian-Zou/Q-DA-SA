# Thinking

We need to allocate remaining pumpkin weights (5,7,9,10,13,14,15) among A,B,C,D so that each sister ends up carrying total weight 34 kg. Current totals: A has 16+3=19. C has 12+1=13. B has 4+2+6=12. D has 11+8=19.

We also have constraints: A and C carry same number of pumpkins. B carries the most (i.e., largest number of pumpkins). Each pumpkin weight between 1-16, all unique? Probably each weight used once. There are 4+3+2+2 = 11 pumpkins already chosen; total weights sum currently: 19 +12+13+19=63 kg.

Total pumpkins left: 7 pumpkins with given weights that must be distributed to reach equal totals of 34 each: current sums need additions:

A needs 34-19=15
C needs 34-13=21
B needs 34-12=22
D needs 34-19=15

We have remaining set [5,7,9,10,13,14,15] sum to 71. Check that needed total: 15+21+22+15 = 73? Wait compute: A 15 + C 21 =36, B 22 =>58, D 15=>73. Sum needed is 73 but remaining weights sum to 71. That seems inconsistent.

Let's recompute current totals: A [16,3] sum=19 correct. B [4,2,6]=12 correct. C [12,1]=13 correct. D[11,8]=19 correct. Total of carried pumpkins so far is 19+12+13+19 =63. Total weight of all 18 pumpkins (since each between 1 and16 but not necessarily all used? Actually there are 4 sisters taking pumpkins grown; we have total of 18 pumpkins? Let's sum all weights from 1-16 except maybe missing ones: All weights 1 to 16 sum is 136. But some weights might be unused if not all 16? We see current weights used: 16,3,4,2,6,12,1,11,8 = nine pumpkins. Left weights not yet carried are listed: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15 => seven more. So total of all 16 pumpkins is indeed 9+7=16? Wait we have only 9 + 7 = 16 weights (from 1 to16). But missing weight '??' Actually list includes all numbers except maybe something: Let's see 1-16 set:

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. The ones used so far are 1,2,3,4,6,8,11,12,16 => nine numbers. Remaining list given: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15 => seven numbers. That sums to all 16 distinct pumpkins.

So total sum of weights = 136. Divided equally among four sisters -> each should carry total weight 34 (since 4*34=136). Good.

Now current totals: A19, B12, C13, D19 sum 63. Remaining sum is 136-63 =73. But we said remaining list sums to 71? Let's recalc sum of listed remaining numbers: 5+7+9+10+13+14+15 = 73! Wait compute precisely: 5+7=12; +9=21; +10=31; +13=44; +14=58; +15=73. Yes it's 73, not 71. earlier I mis-summed. Good so remaining sum 73 matches needed total weight 73.

Now we need to distribute remaining pumpkins among A,C,B,D with constraints: each sister ends at 34 weight. So additions must be:

A needs 15
C needs 21
B needs 22
D needs 15

Check that sums of needs = 73, yes.

We also have constraint A and C carry same number of pumpkins. Currently they have 2 pumpkins each (A has two, C has two). So they must end with equal numbers; could be more added equal count. B carries the most pumpkins, i.e., B's pumpkin count > others. D currently has 2 pumpkins.

We need to assign remaining pumpkins such that:

- For each sister, weight sum added equals needed amount.
- Count constraint: Let a = # additional pumpkins for A, c = # for C, b = # for B, d = # for D. Initially all have 2 pumpkins; after assignment final counts are: A_final=2+a, C_final=2+c, B_final=3+b, D_final=2+d.

Constraints:
- A_final = C_final (since same number).
- B_final > A_final and > C_final and > D_final? "B carries the most" could mean carries the most pumpkins, not weight. So yes B has the greatest count.
Thus: 3+b > 2+a, 3+b > 2+c, 3+b > 2+d.

Also all counts integers >=0.

We need to assign specific weights.

Let's find combos that sum to needed amounts.

Set for A: we need weight 15. Options using remaining numbers: [5,7,9,10,13,14,15]. Need subset summing to 15. Possibilities:
- 15 alone
- 10+5
- 9+...6? Not present.
- 7+5+3? 3 not available. 
Thus possible combos: {15} or {10,5}. Also maybe 13+?2 no.

Similarly D also needs weight 15; same options.

C needs weight 21. Subsets summing to 21:
- 13+8 (8 already used by D). Not allowed.
- 14+7
- 15+...6 none
- 10+5+...6 none
- 9+...12? 12 used by C already cannot repeat? Actually each pumpkin used once; but we can use 12? It's already carried by C. Can't reuse.
- 10+...? 11? Already D has 11, can't double.
But we may use any of remaining numbers only once across all sisters. So for C choose {14,7} = 21 or maybe {13,5,3}? 3 not available; no.

So possible assignments: C gets [14,7]. That uses those two pumpkins. Good.

Now B needs 22. Subset from remaining after giving A and D combos, C gets 14+7. Leftover numbers after removing 14 and 7:

Remaining set initially: {5,9,10,13,15}. (and maybe others used by A,D). Need to choose for B weight 22. Options:
- 5 + 9 + 8? but 8 already D has.
- 5+10+7? 7 used
- 5+13+4? 4 used
- 9+13 =22 (Yes!). That works: {9,13}. Great.

Thus B gets [9,13].

Now we have used A and D combos; need to allocate for them weight 15 each using remaining numbers after giving C and B sets. After C(14,7) and B(9,13), remaining set is {5,10,15}. Wait also maybe others? Let's track all:

All weights: 1-16.

Used so far:
A: 16,3
B: 4,2,6
C:12,1
D:11,8
Remaining: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15

We used C's {14,7}. So left after that: 5,9,10,13,15.

Used B's {9,13}. After that, remaining set is {5,10,15}.

Now we need to give A weight 15 and D weight 15 using these three pumpkins. Since both need weight 15, each will take exactly one of these weights: either 15 or (10+5). But there are only three pumpkins left; cannot give each a single pumpkin if they must each sum 15 with distinct weights unless we use the triple 5,10,15 such that A takes 15 and D takes 10+5. That sums to 15 for D as well. Good.

So final allocation:

- A gets [16,3] + [15] = total weight 34.
- D gets [11,8] + [10,5] = weight 34.
- C gets [12,1] + [14,7] = 34.
- B gets [4,2,6] + [9,13] = 34.

Now counts: A had 2+1=3 pumpkins. D had 2+2=4 pumpkins. Wait D has 4 pumpkins (11,8,10,5). C has 4 pumpkins as well (12,1,14,7) = 4. B originally had 3 pumpkins, added 2 => total 5 pumpkins.

Thus final counts: A=3, C=4, D=4, B=5. But constraint: A and C have the same number of pumpkins. They do not: 3 vs 4. So need to adjust.

We can switch assignments to satisfy that.

Goal: After assignment, counts for A and C equal. And B's count > others.

Let's denote variables:

Let a = # pumpkins added to A
c = # added to C
d = # added to D
b = # added to B

Given weight sums:
a_weight_sum = 15
c_weight_sum = 21
d_weight_sum = 15
b_weight_sum = 22.

Total additional pumpkins: a+c+d+b must equal 7 (number of remaining pumpkins). We have used exactly 1+2+2+2? Actually A gets 1, C gets 2, D gets 2, B gets 2: total added 7. That satisfies counts.

Now we need 2 + a = 2 + c => a=c.

So a and c must be equal count. Currently a=1, c=2. Not equal.

Thus we need to change allocation to have same number of pumpkins for A and C. Since b has to be largest > others. Let's consider possibilities: a=c maybe 0? No because each needs weight sum; can't have 0 unless weight sums zero. So must have at least 1 pumpkin each. So counts likely are either both 1 or both 2, etc.

We can try having a = c =1 (each gets one pumpkin). That would reduce total added pumpkins to 6 (since D and B will use remaining 5?). But we have 7 remaining; so cannot all be singletons? Wait if a=1 and c=1 then b+d must sum to 5 additional pumpkins. That's okay because we have 7 left, using 2 already gives 5 left.

But check weight sums: A needs 15 with one pumpkin -> could be 15 or (10+5) but only one pumpkin allowed; only 15 qualifies. So A would take 15. C needs 21 with one pumpkin cannot because no single pumpkin weighs 21; impossible. Thus a and c cannot both be 1.

Try a=c=2: each gets two pumpkins. Then we need b+d=3 additional pumpkins (since total 7). That could be possible. Let's test weight sums:

A needs 15 from two pumpkins: options {10,5} or maybe {14,?1}? 1 used by C already? But can use other combos using remaining set. After selecting for A and C, we will have D and B assign the rest.

We need to find sets of weights such that:

- For A: sum=15, size=2.
- For C: sum=21, size=2.

Remaining set after A and C must contain 3 pumpkins with total weight 73 - (15+21) = 37, and split between D (needs 15) and B(22). So we need to partition remaining three pumpkins into a subset of two that sums to 15 for D, and one that sums to 22 for B? Wait but b must be size=?? If remaining three pumpkins assigned across D and B with counts maybe 2+1 or 3+0 etc. But B must carry the most pumpkins overall; currently B had 3 base pumpkins plus added count; if we give B 1 more pumpkin (size1) then B final count 4, but D would have at least 2 additional? Let's compute.

If a=c=2, then A_final=2+2=4, C_final=2+2=4. For B and D to have smaller counts, B must have less than 4 or equal? Actually condition: B carries the most pumpkins; so B's final count > others (which are both 4). So B must have at least 5 pumpkins.

Thus B must get at least 3 added pumpkins because currently B has 3. If a=c=2, total added pumpkins = A(2)+C(2) =4. Remaining to reach 7 is 3 additional pumpkins: b+d=3. To give B at least 5 final, b must be >=2 (since starting from 3). If d gets 1 and b gets 2, then counts: B_final=3+2=5 > A_final=4, C_final=4. D_final=2+1=3 < others. Works.

Thus we need to partition remaining three pumpkins into two for D sum15 and one for B sum22? Wait if d=1 (one pumpkin for D) but D needs weight 15; only possible weight is 15 itself. But 15 already maybe used by A or C? Let's examine possibilities.

We need sets:

Remaining weights: initial set {5,7,9,10,13,14,15}. We will allocate to A (2 pumpkins sum15), C (2 sum21). After that leftover 3 will be assigned: D gets some number (maybe 1 or 2) sum 15; B gets rest sum 22.

Goal counts: a=2 c=2 b=2 d=1.

Check weight sums:

- A gets two pumpkins adding to 15. Options for pair sum 15 using available weights:
Possible pairs from set: (5,10), (7,8?) but 8 not in remaining; (9,6?) no; (13,2) etc. So only (5,10). Also (14,?1) none.

- C gets two pumpkins sum 21 from remaining after removing A's weights. After using (5,10), remaining set: {7,9,13,14,15}. Need pair sum 21. Options: (7,14),(8,13)? 8 not; (9,12)? 12 used earlier. So only (7,14) works.

Thus A gets [5,10]; C gets [7,14].

Now remaining weights after that: {9,13,15}. They need to be split into D and B with sums 15 and 22 respectively.

We can give D one pumpkin weight 15. Then remaining for B are {9,13} sum 22 -> works!

Thus assignment:

- A: [16,3] + [5,10]
- C: [12,1] + [7,14]
- D: [11,8] + [15]
- B: [4,2,6] + [9,13]

Now counts:
A had 2 +2 =4 pumpkins.
C had 2+2=4 pumpkins.
D had 2+1=3 pumpkins.
B had 3+2=5 pumpkins.

All constraints satisfied: each total weight 34. A and C same number (4). B carries most (5). Good.

Thus the solution is as above.

Let's produce explanation.

# Answer

**The final sharing**

| Sister | Already chosen pumpkins | New pumpkins added | Total pumpkins | Total weight |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **A**  | \(16,\;3\) | \(5,\;10\) | \(2+2=4\) | \(19+15 = 34\) |
| **B**  | \(4,\;2,\;6\) | \(9,\;13\) | \(3+2=5\) | \(12+22 = 34\) |
| **C**  | \(12,\;1\) | \(7,\;14\) | \(2+2=4\) | \(13+21 = 34\) |
| **D**  | \(11,\;8\) | \(15\) | \(2+1=3\) | \(19+15 = 34\) |

---

### Why this works

* The total weight of all pumpkins is  
  \[
  1+2+\dots +16 = 136.
  \]  
  Four sisters share them, so each must carry \(136/4 = 34\) kg – exactly the totals above.

* **Same number of pumpkins for A and C**:  
  Both end with 4 pumpkins (\(2\) already chosen + \(2\) new).

* **B carries the most pumpkins**:  
  B ends with 5 pumpkins, more than any other sister (A and C have 4, D has 3).

* All remaining weights \( \{5,7,9,10,13,14,15\}\) are used exactly once.

---

### How the assignment was found

1. **Determine the weight each sister still needs**  
   - A: \(34-19 = 15\) kg  
   - B: \(34-12 = 22\) kg  
   - C: \(34-13 = 21\) kg  
   - D: \(34-19 = 15\) kg  

2. **Choose the number of new pumpkins**  
   A and C must have the same final count; starting with 2 each, we need to give them equal extra numbers.  
   Taking two pumpkins for A and for C gives both a total of 4 pumpkins and leaves \(3\) pumpkins for B and D.

3. **Select pairs that sum to the required weights**  
   - For A (15 kg with 2 pumpkins): only \(\{5,10\}\).  
   - For C (21 kg with 2 pumpkins): only \(\{7,14\}\).  

4. **Use the remaining pumpkins for B and D**  
   The leftovers are \(\{9,13,15\}\).  
   • Give D one pumpkin of weight \(15\) (the only way to reach 15 kg with a single pumpkin).  
   • The other two (\(9+13=22\)) go to B.

5. **Check the counts**  
   - A: \(2 + 2 = 4\) pumpkins  
   - C: \(2 + 2 = 4\) pumpkins  
   - D: \(2 + 1 = 3\) pumpkins  
   - B: \(3 + 2 = 5\) pumpkins  

   B has the most, A and C have the same number—exactly what was required.

Thus the pumpkins can be shared as shown in the table above.
