[Thinking]
Okay, let's see. There are four sisters—A, B, C, D—each carrying some pumpkins to the market. Each pumpkin weighs between 1 and 16 kilograms. The total each sister carries is 34 kg. A and C carry the same number of pumpkins. B carries the most. Then there are leftover pumpkins not yet carried: 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 kg.

First, I need to figure out how these uncarried pumpkins (totaling those numbers) will be distributed among the sisters so that each of them can reach their total of 34 kg. Let me start by calculating the current totals for each sister based on their chosen pumpkins and then see what they still need to carry.

Let's list out what's given:

Sister A has already carried: 16 + 3 = 19 kg
Sister B has carried: 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 kg Wait, that's only 12? But the problem says each sister carries 34 kg. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.
The sisters have all chosen some pumpkins they plan to carry as shown below:

A: [16, 3]
B: [4, 2, 6]
C: [12, 1]
D: [11, 8]

So the total each sister is carrying now is:

A: 16 + 3 = 19 kg
B: 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 kg
C: 12 + 1 = 13 kg
D: 11 + 8 = 20 kg
But the problem states that each sister carries 34 kg in total. Wait, this seems contradictory. So maybe these are not all their pumpkins yet? The uncarried ones are listed separately as [5,7,9,10,13,14,15]. Hmm. Maybe they have already picked some (the brackets) and need to pick the remaining from the uncarried list.

So each sister's total must be 34 kg. So currently:

A has 19 kg. Needs 34 - 19 = 15 more kg.
B has 12 kg. Needs 34 - 12 = 22 more kg.
C has 13 kg. Needs 34 -13 =21 more kg.
D has 20 kg. Needs 34 -20=14 more kg.
The uncarried pumpkins are: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15. These need to be distributed among A, B, C, D such that each of their required additional weights is met exactly.

So first, check the total remaining weight needed:

A needs 15kg

B needs 22kg

C needs21kg

D needs14kg

Total needed: 15+22+21+14=72 kg

Total uncarried pumpkins sum up to:5+7+9+10+13+14+15=73. Wait, that's a problem. The total required is 72, but the available pumpkins add up to 73. There's an extra pumpkin of 1kg? But there are no 1kg pumpkins left except in C's already carried ones (C has [12,1], which is part of their initial load). So maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum:

5 +7=12; 12+9=21; 21+10=31; 31+13=44; 44+14=58; 58+15=73. Yes, total is 73kg needed but required is 72. So there's a discrepancy of 1kg. Hmm. That suggests perhaps an error in the problem statement or maybe one pumpkin will be left over? But all pumpkins are between 1 and16 kg, so it's possible that they can't distribute exactly due to this inconsistency. Wait, unless I made a mistake.

Wait, let's check again:

Original carried totals:

A:16+3=19

B:4+2+6=12

C:12+1=13

D:11+8=20

Total so far: 19+12+13+20=64 kg

The total pumpkins should be each sister's 34kg, so 434=136kg. The carried ones sum to 64, the uncarried are 5,7,9,10,13,14,15 which is 73. So 64 +73=137, but 434=136. There's an extra pumpkin of 1kg overcounted here. Wait, that's a problem. Where's that coming from?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the total carried.

A:16+3=19

B:4+2+6=12 (correct)

C:12+1=13 (correct)

D:11+8=20 (correct)

Total carried: 19+12=31; 31+13=44; 44+20=64. Correct.

Undecided pumpkins sum to73. So total would be64+73=137, but should be136. Therefore, there's an inconsistency of +1kg here. That must mean that one pumpkin is counted twice or there is a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, maybe sister C's initial load includes a 1kg pumpkin that's part of the undecided ones? Wait no, because if they have already chosen pumpkins to carry, then those are included in their current total. So perhaps there's an error here. Alternatively, maybe I misread something.

Wait the problem says: "The weights of the pumpkins that have not yet been carried are: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15". So that's seven pumpkins left. Each sister needs to carry some number of these such that their totals become 34kg.

But given the discrepancy in total weight (137 vs 136), there's an extra kg somewhere. That suggests perhaps one pumpkin is counted as part of both carried and undecided? Not sure. Maybe a typo in the problem?

Alternatively, maybe sister C's initial load includes pumpkins not listed here? Wait no, because it's stated that each number indicates how heavy the carried pumpkin is for A,B,C,D respectively.

Wait let me check again:

A has [16,3] so two pumpkins: 16 and3. Total19

B has [4,2,6], three pumpkins: total12

C has [12,1], two pumpkins: total13

D has [11,8], two pumpkins: total20

Total carried by all sisters:64kg.

Undecided pumpkins sum to73kg. So 64+73=137≠136. Hmm.

Is there an error in the problem statement? Maybe sister C's second pumpkin is not1 but something else? Wait if it's written as [12,1], that's two pumpkins totaling13kg. If instead it was a typo and should be [11,2], then total would be13 as well. But no, that doesn't resolve the discrepancy.

Alternatively, maybe one of the undecided pumpkins is counted in both lists by mistake? For example, if 5 or7 etc., but they are distinct numbers. So perhaps there's an error here.

But given that this is a problem presented to me, I need to work with it as stated. Maybe proceed and see where it leads. Perhaps ignore the discrepancy for now.

So moving forward: sisters A,B,C,D need additional:

A needs15kg

B needs22kg

C needs21kg

D needs14kg

Available pumpkins:5,7,9,10,13,14,15 (sum73). They require72kg. So one pumpkin is extra. Maybe we have to leave out the1kg pumpkin? Wait but there's no 1kg in the undecided list except sister C already has a1kg carried.

Alternatively, perhaps it's allowed that total isn't exact because of an error. But maybe I miscalculated something.

Wait wait: The problem says "each pumpkin weighs between one and16 kilograms". So all pumpkins are integer weights from1 to16. The sisters have each chosen some pumpkins they plan to carry (the ones in brackets), but the uncarried ones are separate. Wait, no—wait the wording is:

"The sisters have all chosen some pumpkins they plan to carry, as shown below. Each number indicates how heavy the carried pumpkin is: [A,B,C,D's lists]. The weights of the pumpkins that have not yet been carried are: 5,7,9,10,13,14,15."

So "have planned to carry" implies those are already selected and will be taken to market. So their current totals include those numbers. Then there are additional pumpkins (the undecided ones) left in the village that they haven't chosen yet but might take or not.

But each sister must end up carrying exactly34kg. Therefore, for sisters who have more than34kg so far? Wait no: A has19, B12, C13, D20. So all are below 34 except none. So they need to pick additional pumpkins from the undecided list such that their totals become34.

But as we saw, total needed is72kg but available is73kg, which suggests one pumpkin will not be picked or there's an extra kg somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps sister C's initial load includes a1kg pumpkin that's part of the uncarried ones? But no, because it's stated they have already chosen some to carry. So those are separate. The carried ones and undecided ones are distinct.

This inconsistency is puzzling. Maybe proceed assuming that there's an extra kg somewhere that we can adjust for. Alternatively, perhaps sister C's total needed is21kg, but maybe one of the pumpkins can't be assigned due to size or other constraints.

Alternatively, check if each pumpkin in the uncarried list (5,7,9,10,13,14,15) needs to be allocated such that A,B,C,D get their required amounts. Let's see:

First, let's note that sister B currently has12kg and needs22kg more. So she needs 22 kg from the remaining pumpkins. Similarly for others.

Looking at available weights:5,7,9,10,13,14,15.

Let's list them sorted descending:15,14,13,10,9,7,5.

Sister B needs the most weight (22kg). Let's try to assign her the largest possible first.

If sister B takes 15 and14: total29. That's more than needed. Alternatively, maybe she can't take both. Wait but we have seven pumpkins; they need to all be assigned since there's no mention of any pumpkin left unassigned beyond what's necessary? The problem says "how do the rest get shared out"—implying that each sister gets some from the remaining list until their totals are 34.

But given the discrepancy in total weight, perhaps one pumpkin is not taken. Which one?

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake and the intended sum of undecided pumpkins is72kg instead of73. If that's the case, then we have to exclude one pumpkin. Let's check which exclusion would make sense.

If we remove 15kg: remaining sum=73-15=58

But required total needed is72. Doesn't help.

If we remove14kg:73-14=59

Still not 72.

Wait this approach isn't working. Alternatively, maybe the problem statement has an error in the carried totals or undecided pumpkins.

Alternatively, perhaps sister C's initial load includes a pumpkin that's part of the uncarried ones? But no, because she's already planning to carry them.

This is confusing. Maybe proceed under the assumption that there's a typo and one pumpkin should be 6 instead of15, making total sum64+72=136. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated something.

Wait sister D has11+8=19kg currently? Wait no:11+8=19 for A,B,C,D:

A:16+3=19

B:4+2+6=12

C:12+1=13

D:11+8=19. So total carried is19+12+13+20=64.

Undecided pumpkins sum to73. 64+73=137, but should be136. Therefore, one pumpkin must not be assigned. Which one?

If we remove the15kg pumpkin from undecided list, then total would be64+72=136. So perhaps sister C's required21kg could take the remaining.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different allocation.

But let's try to proceed.

Assuming that all pumpkins except one are used, which is 73-1=72. But we don't know which one. Alternatively, ignore the discrepancy and see if it's possible with some adjustment.

Let's attempt to assign the needed amounts:

Sister A needs15kg

Available:5,7,9,10,13,14,15 (sum73)

Sister B needs22kg

C needs21kg

D needs14kg

Total needed:72. So one pumpkin is left out. Let's see.

Let me try to assign the largest first where possible.

Start with sister D needing14kg. The closest would be 13+1, but there's no 1 in undecided list. Alternatively, 9+5=14. So maybe D takes9 and5: total14. Then those are assigned.

Then remaining pumpkins:7,10,13,14,15

Sister B needs22kg. Let's assign the largest first:

15+14=29 (too much). Maybe take smaller ones.

Wait 15 is big. If sister B takes15, then she still needs 22-15=7. Is there a7 available? Yes. So B could take15 and7: total22. Then those are assigned.

Remaining pumpkins:10,13,14

Sister C needs21kg. Let's see:10+13+14=37 (too much). But she only needs21. Alternatively, 10+13-2= but can't subtract. Maybe 10+11? No 11 available.

Wait remaining are10,13,14. Sum is37. Sister C needs21. So perhaps take10 and11—but no. Wait maybe sister D already took5 and9, so the left over for B was7,15; then remaining are10,13,14.

Sister A needs15kg. Let's see: she could take10+5 but 5 is taken by D? No, D took9 and5. So if D has9 and5, those are gone. Then available after B takes7 and15 (if that's the case) would be left with13 and14.

Wait this approach may not work. Let me try again step by step.

Alternative allocation:

Start with sister C needing21kg. Let's assign her 10+13=23. That's over. Maybe9+12, but no. Alternatively,7+14=21. So take7 and14: total21. Assign to C.

Then remaining pumpkins:5,9,10,13,15

Sister B needs22kg. Take15+7 (but 7 is taken by C). Wait available are5,9,10,13,15. Sister B could take15+ something else. Let's try15+5=20. Needs2 more—no pumpkin left for that. Alternatively,15+10=25. Too much. Hmm.

Alternatively, sister B takes13+9=22 exactly. So assign13 and9 to B: total22.

Then remaining pumpkins:5,10,15

Sister A needs15kg. She can take15 alone (needs0 more). Then she has16+3 +15=34? Wait no—A already has carried 16 and3 totaling19 kg. If sister A takes another15kg pumpkin, her total becomes19+15=34. Perfect.

Then remaining pumpkins:5 and10

Sister D needs14kg. But only have5 and10 left. Assign them both:5+10=15. That's over by1kg. Not good.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the allocation.

Wait let's check again:

If C takes7 and14 (total21), B takes13 and9 (22), A takes15 (needs15 to reach34 from19→34 needs15). Then D is left with5 and10: total15kg. But sister D only needed14kg. So this doesn't work.

Alternatively, adjust some assignments.

Another approach:

Sister C needs21kg. Let's give her 9+12? No. Wait available are5,7,9,10,13,14,15.

Wait maybe sister B takes the two largest:15 and something else. If she takes15 and7=22, but then D has to take from remaining.

Alternatively:

Sister A needs15kg. Let's assign her 10+5=15. So A gets10 and5.

Then remaining pumpkins:7,9,13,14,15

Sister B needs22kg. Take15+7=22. Assign those.

Now remaining:9,13,14.

Sister C needs21kg. Needs to take from9,13,14. 9+12? No. 13+8? No. Maybe take all three:9+13+14=36. Too much. But she only needs21. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait sister D also needs14kg. If C takes some and D takes others:

From remaining after A and B have taken10,5;15,7: left are9,13,14.

C needs21kg. Let's say she takes14+7=21 but 7 is already taken by B. Alternatively, take13+8? No. Wait this isn't working.

Alternatively, sister D could need14kg from the remaining3 pumpkins (9,13,14). The only way is to give her all three:9+5=14? But she needs14. So if she takes14 alone, that's exactly what she needs. Then:

A:10+5=15

B:15+7=22

C: ?

D:14

But then remaining are9 and13 for C. She needs21kg but already has carried pumpkins totaling34-13=21? Wait no—wait sister C's total is currently 12+1=13, so she needs34-13=21 more. If D takes14 (totaling20), and B takes22, then A takes15 (19→34). Then remaining are9 and13 for C to reach21: but9+13=22, which would give her total13+22=35, exceeding by1.

This is tricky. Maybe the initial assumption that all pumpkins must be assigned except one due to the discrepancy is correct. If we leave out15kg pumpkin:

Total needed72. So assign75-3=72? Wait 73-1=72. Remove any pumpkin of x kg where x=?

Wait sister B needs22, which could take9+13=22. Sister C takes14+5+2—wait no, but there's a7 and10 left.

Alternatively:

Assign to A:15 (needs15)

To D:14

Remaining pumpkins:5,7,9,10,13

Sister B needs22: let's do10+12? No. 9+13=22.

Then sister C needs21 from remaining5,7: can't make21. So this doesn't work.

Alternatively:

A takes15 (needs15)

C takes14+7=21

D takes10+?

Wait D needs14. If A has15, B has9+13=22, C has14+7=21, then left with5 and10 for D: 5+10=15≠14. Doesn't work.

Alternatively:

A takes10+5=15 (needs15)

B takes15+ something? But if we assigned A to take10+5, B can't take15 anymore.

Wait maybe sister C needs21kg. If she takes13+8, but no 8. Alternatively,9+12—no. Maybe7+14=21. Assign that.

Then:

A:10+5=15

B: ?

C:7+14=21

D:?

Left with3 pumpkins:9 and15? Wait original undecided were5,7,9,10,13,14,15. If A takes10 and5; C takes7 and14; then left are9,13,15.

Sister B needs22kg from these three. 15+7=22 but 7 is taken by C. So take15+ nothing? No. Alternatively,13+9=22. Assign that to B.

Then D has remaining15 kg pumpkin. But sister D needs14kg. Can't do. This doesn't work.

Hmm. Maybe the problem requires leaving out one pumpkin of1kg, but since there's no such in undecided list except C's initial load, which is already accounted for.

Alternatively, maybe my approach is wrong. Let's think differently.

The carried totals:

A:19

B:12

C:13

D:20

Total needed per sister:

A needs15 more (34-19)

B needs22 (34-12)

C needs21 (34-13)

D needs14 (34-20)

Available pumpkins sum to73, but need72. So one pumpkin must be left out.

Assuming that the extra1kg is a mistake and we proceed by omitting any pumpkin of x kg where 73 -x =72 →x=1. But there's no1kg in undecided list except C's initial load, which is already carried. Therefore, maybe sister A or B can take an additional small pumpkin not part of the listed ones? No, because all pumpkins are accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps one sister has to adjust her total by taking less than needed due to weight constraints but that contradicts "each sister carries 34kg in total".

This is very confusing. Maybe there's a different way to allocate.

Let me try another allocation:

Sister D needs14kg. Assign D the13+1 kg, but there's no1kg left except C's initial load. So assign D9+5=14.

Then remaining pumpkins:7,10,13,14,15

Sister B needs22kg. Let's take15+7=22.

Remaining:10,13,14

Sister A needs15kg. Assign her 10+5—but5 was taken by D in this scenario? Wait no—D took9 and5 here. So remaining after B takes15 and7 are left with10,13,14.

A would need to take from these: maybe10+ something=15→ but there's nothing else smaller than5 which is already used. Alternatively, A can't get15kg now.

Alternatively, sister C needs21kg. Take10+11—but no 11. Or9+12—no. So this approach fails.

Alternative allocation:

D takes14 (needs exactly14).

B takes13+9=22.

A needs15: take5+10=15.

C needs21: remaining are7 and others? Wait after assigning D:14, B:13+9, A:5+10, then left with7. C needs to get 21 kg but only has7 left from the undecided list plus her carried ones which total34-13=21. So she already had12+1=13, so needs8 more? Wait no—C's current is13kg (12+1), and she's supposed to have34kg in total. Therefore, C needs31kg more. Wait wait a minute! I think I've been misunderstanding.

Wait the problem says "each sister carries 34 kilograms in total". So each sister must end up with exactly34kg, combining both what they currently have (as per their chosen pumpkins) and whatever additional they take from the undecided list.

But earlier calculation was wrong. Let me recalculate:

Sister A: already has16+3=19 kg. Needs 34-19=15kg more.

Sister B:4+2+6=12 → needs22kg

Sister C:12+1=13 → needs21kg (34-13)

Sister D:11+8=20 → needs14kg (34-20)

So that's correct. The totals needed are as before.

But the sum of required weights is72, while undecided pumpkins total73. So one pumpkin must be left out. Since there's no1kg in the list except C's initial load, which is already counted, this suggests an error. But given that it's a problem posed to me, perhaps I need to proceed assuming that all are assigned and find a way.

Wait maybe sister A can take15 kg alone (needs15), sister D takes14 kg alone (takes14). Then remaining pumpkins:5,7,9,10,13

Sister B needs22kg. Assign her 15- no wait she's taking from the undecided list which now is left as after assigning to A and D:

Undecided originally were [5,7,9,10,13,14,15]. If A takes15, D takes14: remaining are5,7,9,10,13.

Sister B needs22kg. From these: 10+12=22 (no). 13+9=22. Assign those to B.

Now sister C needs21kg from the remaining pumpkins:5 and7. But 5+7=12 <21. Not enough.

So this doesn't work.

Alternative approach:

Sister A takes14 kg? No, she needs15. If we can't find a way to make it sum correctly with one pumpkin left out, perhaps there's another allocation.

Wait what if sister C's additional pumpkins are not from the undecided list but includes some of her own carried ones? But no, because they have already chosen which ones to carry.

Alternatively, maybe my initial assumption about A's current total is wrong. Wait:

A has [16,3]. Total19kg. Needs15 more. Correct.

Wait 16+3=19. Yes.

B:4+2+6=12. Yes.

C:12+1=13. Yes.

D:11+8=20. Yes.

Hmm.

Another angle: the problem says "each sister carries 34 kilograms in total". So maybe they can adjust their carried pumpkins, but no—the brackets indicate they've already chosen specific ones to carry. The undecided are separate.

Given that there's a discrepancy of +1kg between needed and available, perhaps one pumpkin is not assigned at all, making the totals work. Let's see:

If we leave out15kg pumpkin from the list (total becomes73-15=58), but sister B needs22 kg. 13+9=22. Sister C takes7+14=21. Sister A takes10+5=15. Sister D takes11? No, she already has carried pumpkins.

Wait no—sister D's total is20kg and needs14 more. If we leave out the15kg pumpkin:

Undecided list becomes [5,7,9,10,13,14].

Total sum:5+7=12; +9=21; +10=31; +13=44; +14=58.

Sister A needs15kg: take14+1—but no 1. Or take11? No. So assign her to take10+5=15.

B needs22: take13+9=22.

C needs21: take7+14=21.

D needs14: takes0, since all are assigned. But D already has20kg and can't carry more than34-20=14. Wait but if we left out the15kg pumpkin, then total available is58. Sister A gets10+5=15; B13+9=22; C7+14=21; Total taken:15+22+21=58. That works! Then D doesn't get anything additional? But sister D already has20kg and needs to reach34kg by taking4 more kg? Wait no:

Wait if we leave out the15kg pumpkin, total undecided is58.

Sister A takes10+5=15 (needs15)

B takes13+9=22

C takes7+14=21

Total taken:15+22+21=58. Perfect.

But sister D's current total is20kg and needs34-20=14 more kg. But there's no pumpkins left in the undecided list after this allocation (since we took all except maybe none). So where does she get her additional14kg? She can't, because we've already assigned all available pumpkins from the original 73 minus15. Wait, but if sister D needs to take4kg and there are no more, then how?

Wait I think there's confusion here. If we leave out the15kg pumpkin (total undecided58), then after assigning A,B,C as above:

A:10+5=15

B:13+9=22

C:7+14=21

Total assigned from undecided list:58.

Then sister D's carried weight is20kg, needs34-20=14 more. But there are no pumpkins left in the undecided list to assign her. Therefore, this approach doesn't work either.

Therefore, leaving out a pumpkin of1kg would allow A,B,C,D to get their required weights but leaves D with nothing, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, leave out another pumpkin. For example, leave out7kg:

Undecided total:73-7=66

Sister B needs22kg: take15+5=20 (too much). Or13+9=22.

If sister C takes14+ something else? Wait this is getting too convoluted.

Perhaps the correct answer requires a different allocation where one pumpkin isn't assigned to any sister, acknowledging the discrepancy. But since all pumpkins must be carried or not?

The problem states "the rest of pumpkins get shared out"—implying they are distributed among the sisters.

Given that there's an inconsistency in total weight (73 instead of72), perhaps the intended solution is:

A takes15kg alone

B takes13+9=22

C takes14+7=21

D takes10+5=15, but she needs only14. Wait no—wait D's needed was14.

Wait this isn't working.

Alternative approach inspired by possible typo in carried weights:

If sister C had [12, something else] instead of1kg to make her total sum correct with the rest. But since problem statement is given as such, I need to work with it.

Perhaps the answer expects that despite the discrepancy, we proceed and assign pumpkins accordingly, possibly having one pumpkin not assigned or a mistake in the question. Given that this is an exam-style problem, there's likely a specific allocation expected.

Let me try once more:

Undecided:5,7,9,10,13,14,15

Sister A needs15kg: take15 alone.

Sister B needs22kg: take13+9=22.

Sister C needs21kg: take14+7=21.

Sister D needs14kg: takes nothing. But she must carry some to reach34kg from20. Contradiction.

Alternatively, sister D can take10 and4—no 4 available. Or5 and9: but A took15.

This seems impossible given the numbers.

Wait another angle: Maybe one of the sisters has a carried pumpkin that is also in the undecided list? But no—they've already chosen their pumpkins to carry.

Alternatively, maybe sister D's total needed is20+14=34. Wait she currently carries11+8=19kg. Needs5 more kg. So if we assign her 5kg from the undecided list:

Undecided: after A takes15, B takes13+9=22, C takes7+14=21; D takes5.

Total assigned:15+22+21+5=63. Undecided sum was73-5=68? Wait no—original undecided sum is73. If we assign to D the5kg pumpkin:

Undecided remaining after A(15), B(13,9), C(7,14): 5 and10.

Sister D needs14: takes5+ something but only have5 left. No.

Alternatively, sister D takes5+10=15—over by1.

This is frustrating. Given the time I've spent and no clear solution due to the discrepancy, I might conclude that there's a typo in the problem statement. However, since this is an exercise, perhaps proceed with the allocation ignoring the 1kg difference:

Assign as follows:

A takes15 (needs15)

B takes13+9=22

C takes14+7=21

D needs14: but only have5 and10 left from undecided list after A,B,C take15,13,9,14,7. So D has to take5+10=15kg which is over by1kg.

But maybe the problem expects this allocation despite the 1kg discrepancy. Or perhaps sister C takes11 instead of something else—but there's no11 in the undecided list except her initial load.

Alternatively, swap some assignments:

If B doesn't take13 and9 but takes14+8 (but D has already taken a pumpkin). This is not working.

Wait another idea: Maybe sister A needs15kg more. If she can take10+5=15 from the available pumpkins.

Sister C needs21kg: take7+14=21

Sister B needs22kg: take13+9=22

Then remaining pumpkins are: none, since all have been assigned except D's needed4kg which isn't there.

Wait no—original undecided list is5,7,9,10,13,14,15. After A takes10+5, C takes7+14, B takes13+9: all seven pumpkins are taken (10,5;7,14;13,9). Total assigned to them sums to10+5+7+14+13+9=52kg. Required total needed is72-19(A's current)+... wait no:

Wait sister A currently has19kg and needs15 more: so takes15 from undecided (sum of pumpkins she adds).

But if she's taking10 and5, that's15kg.

B takes13 and9 (22)

C takes7 and14 (21)

Total added to their totals:

A becomes34

B becomes12+22=34

C becomes13+21=34

D remains at20. But sister D needs to reach34 as well. So this approach fails for D.

So in this allocation, all except D have reached34kg, but D still has20kg and cannot take anything because pumpkins are exhausted. Therefore, invalid.

Therefore, the only way is that one pumpkin isn't assigned. The problem might accept this with a note, but since it's asked to "how do the rest of pumpkins get shared out", implying all except some must be assigned. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is:

A takes15

B takes13+9=22

C takes14+7=21

D takes10+5-1kg (but there's no negative)

Alternatively, maybe sister C takes a different combination.

Wait if we give D 11 kg from her carried pumpkins? But she's already carrying them. No.

Given that I'm stuck due to the discrepancy and possibly an error in problem statement, I'll posit that despite the total sum issue, the intended distribution is:

A:15

B:13+9=22

C:14+7=21

D:10+5-1kg (but this requires a -1 which isn't possible). Alternatively, D takes10 and4 kg but no.

Alternatively, sister C could take 12+ something else from her initial load, but she's already carrying those.

This is really perplexing. Maybe the answer expects that despite the sum discrepancy, we proceed with:

A gets15

B gets13+9=22

C gets14+7=21

D gets10 and5 (total15), acknowledging an extra kilogram in D's share which might be overlooked due to problem statement error.

But since each sister must have exactly34kg, this isn't valid. Therefore, there must be another allocation.

Wait one last try:

Sister A needs15kg: take14+1—no 1 available. Take10+5=15

Sister B needs22kg: take13+9=22

Sister C needs21kg: take7+14=21

Sister D needs14kg: but no pumpkins left.

This is impossible. Therefore, the problem must have an error. However, given that this is a puzzle question, there's likely a specific solution expected despite the apparent discrepancy.

Wait wait! Maybe I miscounted sister C's needed kg. Let me check again:

Sister A has19kg carried; needs34-19=15

B:12→22 (needs22)

C:13→21 (needs21)

D:20→14 (needs14)

Total needed:72.

Available pumpkins sum to73.

Assuming that one pumpkin is not assigned, which would be the smallest possible to minimize impact. The smallest uncarried pumpkin is5kg. If we leave out5kg:

Then total available=73-5=68. Still need more than required (72). Not helpful.

Leave out7:73-7=66. 66 needed vs72. No.

Wait no, the discrepancy is that even if we use all pumpkins except one of any weight, it's still not enough.

Alternatively, perhaps sister C's current total is12+1=13kg, but maybe she needs34kg in total, so requires31kg more? Wait wait! Hold on. This might be the mistake!

Wait the problem says "each sister carries 34 kilograms in total". Does this mean that each sister must have a combined weight of34kg from both carried and undecided pumpkins?

Yes! I think I've been misunderstanding completely.

Each sister has already chosen some pumpkins to carry (their initial list), but they need to pick additional ones from the remaining so that their TOTAL (initial + new) is34kg. Therefore, my earlier approach was wrong because I assumed the current totals are part of the 34kg, but actually, they have not yet picked all required pumpkins.

For example, sister A has already chosen [16,3] summing to19kg, so she needs to pick more from the undecided list to reach34kg. Similarly for others.

This changes everything! I think this is the key misunderstanding. The carried pumpkins are part of their total 34kg; they need to add more from the remaining pumpkins to reach exactly34kg each.

So recalculate:

Sister A has19kg (16+3). Needs34-19=15kg more from undecided.

B has12kg. Needs22kg more.

C has13kg. Needs21kg more.

D has20kg. Needs14kg more.

Available pumpkins:5,7,9,10,13,14,15 sum73kg.

Total needed:15+22+21+14=72kg. So one pumpkin of1kg is missing to reach73→ but there's no such in the list except C's initial load which is already counted. Therefore, this suggests that sister D needs to take an extra kilogram from somewhere, but that's not possible.

Wait unless I've made a mistake here. Wait if each sister must total34kg including their initially carried pumpkins plus newly picked ones:

A:19 + x =34 ⇒x=15

B:12 + y=34 ⇒y=22

C:13 + z=34⇒z=21

D:20 + w=34⇒w=14

Total needed from undecided:15+22+21+14=72kg. Available pumpkins sum73kg. So one pumpkin of1kg is extra.

But there's no1kg in the list except C's initial load, which is already part of her carried weight. Therefore, this suggests that sister D must take an additional kilogram beyond what she needs, but that's not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps my calculation of what's needed for each sister is incorrect.

Wait let's do it again:

Sister A currently has19kg from [16,3]. Needs34-19=15 more kg.

Correct.

B:12→22 (needs22)

C:13→21

D:20→14

Total needed72. Available73.

So there's one extra kilogram somewhere. This can only happen if sister D takes an additional kilogram beyond her required14kg, but that's not allowed since she can't carry more than34kg. Therefore, this suggests that the problem has a mistake. However, given that it's posed as a puzzle, perhaps we are to ignore the discrepancy and proceed.

Assuming that all pumpkins must be assigned (leaving out one due to error), let's attempt:

Sister A needs15: assign her5+10=15

B needs22:13+9=22

C needs21:14+7=21

D needs14: takes nothing. But she can't.

Alternatively, sister D takes the remaining pumpkin of1kg, but there is none.

Therefore, this problem cannot be solved as stated due to contradictory total weights. However, given that it's likely intended to have a solution, perhaps there's an error in my calculations.

Wait another possibility: Maybe sister C's initial load includes pumpkins from both carried and undecided lists? But no—the problem states "the sisters have all chosen some pumpkins they plan to carry", implying the ones listed are already selected for transport. The undecided ones are separate.

Given that, perhaps the answer is:

A takes15kg

B takes13+9=22kg

C takes14+7=21kg

D takes5 kg (but she needs14kg). Not possible.

Alternatively, sister D must take10 and4, but no 4 available.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given the problem's inconsistency, I'll posit that despite the total discrepancy of1kg, the intended distribution is:

A:15

B:13+9=22

C:14+7=21

D:5 kg (but needs14). Therefore, there's an error in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps sister C takes a different combination. If she takes10+11—but no 11 available. Or12+9 but that's her initial load.

No, this seems impossible.

Given that I can't find a valid allocation without exceeding or falling short due to the discrepancy, and considering that maybe there's a typo in one of the carried weights:

For example, if sister B had [4,2,6] summing to12kg, which is correct. If instead her pumpkins were different, like [5,7], but no.

Alternatively, perhaps sister C's initial load was supposed to be[11,1] totaling12kg, same as A? But the problem states it's12 and1.

Given that I can't resolve this contradiction logically, I'll conclude that there's a mistake in the problem statement. However, since an answer is required, here's the best possible allocation ignoring the 1kg discrepancy:

A takes15

B takes13+9=22

C takes14+7=21

D takes5 kg (but needs14). So D cannot get her remaining4kg.

Therefore, this suggests that either there's a typo in sister C's initial load or an extra pumpkin of1kg left unassigned. If we assume the problem intended for total undecided to sum72kg by omitting15kg:

Then A:10+5=15

B:13+9=22

C:14+7=21 (but where is12 from her carried? Wait no—her current load is13, needs21 more. If C takes14+7=21.

D: Then remaining pumpkins are none except if we omit15kg.

Thus:

Undecided after omitting15:5,7,9,10,13,14

A takes10+5=15

B takes13+9=22

C takes14+7=21

Total taken from undecided:15+22+21=58. Undecided total was73-15=58. Correct.

D's carried weight is20kg and needs34→ she doesn't take anything, which contradicts the requirement that all pumpkins must be shared out (since D hasn't picked any more). But sister D has to pick some from undecided list to reach34kg. Therefore, this allocation fails for D.

Therefore, no valid solution exists under given constraints due to discrepancy in total weight.

[Answer]
The rest of the pumpkins are distributed as follows:

A needs 15 kg: Takes [10, 5]
B needs 22 kg: Takes [13, 9]
C needs 21 kg: Takes [14, 7]
D needs 14 kg: Must take the remaining pumpkin(s). However, there's an inconsistency in total weight (73 vs required 72), suggesting one pumpkin remains unassigned. The closest valid allocation is:

A takes 10 + 5 = 15 kg,

B takes 13 + 9 = 22 kg,

C takes 14 + 7 = 21 kg,

D cannot receive the remaining pumpkins due to discrepancy.

But acknowledging an error, a possible distribution (assuming one pumpkin omitted):

Final Answer:

A: \boxed{10} and \boxed{5}, B: \boxed{13} and \boxed{9}, C: \boxed{14} and \boxed{7}. D cannot receive the required pumpkins due to total weight discrepancy.
