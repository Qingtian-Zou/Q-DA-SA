# Question

The fog has made a sign impossible to read. Its content only consists of numbers, but the townsfolk can't recall the exact order in which the numbers appear. They do remember the following:

- Each number from 1 to 9 appears once.
- 5 is between two larger numbers.
- 3 is between two smaller numbers.
- 7 is between two larger numbers.
- The first number is 9 and the last number is 1.

Can you figure out what is written on the sign?
