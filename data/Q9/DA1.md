# Thinking

We have to determine a permutation of digits 1-9 with constraints:

- Each number appears once: so it's a permutation of 1..9
- 5 is between two larger numbers. Means both neighbors (adjacent left and right?) The phrase "between" likely means directly adjacent? Typically "is between two larger numbers" could mean that the number immediately to its left is larger, and the number immediately to its right is also larger; i.e., both neighbors are larger than 5. But could also allow either side? Usually "between two larger numbers" might be interpreted as there exist larger numbers on each side, not necessarily adjacent. Let's assume adjacency: 5's immediate neighbors must both be >5.

- Similarly "3 is between two smaller numbers." Means both neighboring digits are less than 3. Since digits range 1-9 and 3's smaller numbers are {1,2}. So its neighbors must be 1 or 2? But they need to be smaller than 3, so possible neighbors are 1 or 2.

- "7 is between two larger numbers." Wait 7 is between two larger numbers: but there are no numbers larger than 7 besides 8 and 9. So both neighbors must be >7: i.e., 8 and/or 9. But 9 is first number, so 7 can't have 9 as left neighbor? Actually first number is 9; last number is 1.

So arrangement length 9 positions labeled 1..9 with digits accordingly. First position =9, last=1.

We need to place numbers satisfying adjacency constraints for 5,3,7.

Let's denote permutation: p1=9, p2=?, ... p8=?, p9=1.

Constraints:
- For any index i (not endpoints), p_i's neighbors are p_{i-1} and p_{i+1}.
- If p_i =5 => both neighbors >5.
- If p_i =3 => both neighbors <3 (i.e., 1 or 2).
- If p_i=7 => both neighbors >7 (8 or 9).

We have digits left: {2,4,6,8}. We need to place them appropriately.

Additionally, note that if 5 has neighbors >5 and 5 cannot be at endpoints. Similarly for 3 and 7 cannot be endpoints.

Also note the last digit is 1; first is 9.

Let's attempt search manually.

We know 3's neighbors must be <3: i.e., only {1,2}. But since 1 is at end (position 9) could be neighbor of 3 if position 8=3 and 7 neighbor maybe 2? Let's analyze possibilities:

Position index positions 1..9.

Let's denote unknowns with placeholders.

p1 = 9

p9 = 1

We have digits left: {2,3,4,5,6,7,8} to place in positions 2-8 inclusive (7 positions). Among them constraints.

Consider 3's neighbors must be smaller than 3. The only numbers <3 are 1 and 2. 1 is at position 9; it could neighbor 3 if 3 at position 8. Then the other neighbor would need to be also <3 i.e., 2 (since 1 cannot appear twice). So if p8=3, then its neighbors p7 and p9 must be 2 and 1 in some order; but p9 already 1 fixed. So p7 must be 2. That would satisfy.

Alternatively, 3 could be at position 2: its neighbors would be p1=9 and p3 unknown. But neighbor 9>3 not <3 -> fails. So 3 cannot be near first element because left neighbor would be 9 >3. Similarly if 3 at position 8 we already considered. Could 3 be somewhere else, with neighbors both smaller? Let's think: possible positions for 3 are where its two neighbors could both be 1 or 2? Since only 2 numbers less than 3 (except itself). We have only one of them left: 2 plus 1 at end. So 3 must be adjacent to both 1 and 2 as neighbors in some order. But 1 is at position9, so 3 must occupy position8 to have neighbor 9? Wait 3 cannot have 9 neighbor because >3 not <3. So 3's neighbors must be 1 and 2; but since 1 is only at pos9, for 3 to neighbor 1, 3 must be at position8. That leaves 2 as other neighbor. So indeed the only possible location for 3 is position8 with p7=2 (or maybe p9? Wait if p3=1 and p5=2? but 3 cannot have 1 on left because left neighbor would need to be <3; 1 qualifies, but right neighbor could be 2. But 1 is at pos9 only; so if 3 is not adjacent to 9 it can't have 1 as a neighbor). So yes, 3 must be at position8 with neighbors positions7 and9. So p8=3. Then p9=1 fixed. So p7=2.

Thus we placed: p7=2, p8=3. Good.

Now consider 5's neighbors >5 (i.e., from set {6,7,8,9}). Since 9 is at pos1, but that's not adjacent to 5 unless 5 at position2 or 8? Wait 8? Actually adjacency: if 5 at pos2, left neighbor would be 9; right neighbor unknown. So one neighbor >5 (9). The other neighbor must also be >5 from {6,7,8}. So possible.

If 5 at pos8? But pos8=3 fixed; can't.

If 5 at pos7? p7 already 2. So can't.

If 5 at pos6 or 4, etc. Let's consider.

Similarly for 7's neighbors >7 meaning must be 8 or 9. Since 9 is at position1 and maybe others adjacent to it but only one neighbor of 9: position2. So 7 cannot be adjacent to 9 because then its left/right neighbor would be 9 which qualifies but the other neighbor must also be >7 (i.e., 8). So 7 could have neighbors 9 and 8 or both 8? Let's analyze positions.

Let's list positions:

1:9
2:
3:
4:
5:
6:
7:2
8:3
9:1

Remaining numbers to place in positions 2-6: digits {4,5,6,7,8}. Wait we also still have digit 4? yes. 5 placed? not yet. So set = {4,5,6,7,8}.

Constraints:

- 5's neighbors must be >5 -> meaning its left and right positions both from {6,7,8,9}. 9 only at position1 but adjacency to pos2 if 5 is at pos2; else not.

- 7's neighbors must be >7 -> i.e., neighbors from {8,9}.

- Additionally, note that 4 doesn't have constraints. But it will interact with others due to neighbor conditions for 5 and 7.

We need to place digits 4,5,6,7,8 into positions 2-6 such that above constraints hold.

Let's analyze potential placements:

Positions 2,3,4,5,6 correspond to sequence.

Remember neighbors of pos1 (9) is only pos2. If we put 7 at position2, its left neighbor would be 9 which satisfies >7; right neighbor must also be >7 -> so right neighbor would need to be 8 (since 9 already used). So if p2=7 then p3 must be 8.

Similarly if p6 is adjacent to pos9? Actually last position 9 has left neighbor at pos8=3 (<5 etc). But 7 cannot be at pos8 because it's 3. So no.

Let's explore possibilities systematically via reasoning.

Case analysis:

We have positions 2-6 with digits {4,5,6,7,8}.

Constraints: 
- For 5: neighbors >5 => left neighbor and right neighbor must belong to {6,7,8}. That means both adjacent positions of the place where 5 sits must be from that set. So 5 cannot be at position2? because its left neighbor pos1 is 9>5 qualifies; right neighbor pos3 must be from {6,7,8}. That's okay if we put e.g., 6 or 7 or 8 in pos3.

If 5 at position6: left neighbor pos5 must be >5 (6-8), right neighbor pos7=2 which is <5 not allowed. So 5 cannot be at pos6 because right neighbor would be 2 (<5). Similarly, if 5 at pos4 or 5 etc, check neighbors.

Thus possible positions for 5: maybe positions 2,3,4,5 but not 6. Because after position5 right neighbor may be position6 which is unknown; we can ensure >5. Position4 left neighbor pos3 might also >5? We need to set accordingly.

Similarly 7's neighbors must be >7 meaning only {8,9}. Since 9 already at pos1, so for 7 to satisfy both sides being >7, we need: if 7 adjacent to 9 on one side, other side must be 8. So possible positions:

- If p2=7 then p3 must be 8.
- If p6=7? Then left neighbor at pos5 must be 8 or 9 but 9 only at pos1 so can't; thus pos6 cannot be 7 unless left neighbor is 8 and right neighbor is (pos7=2) which fails because 2 not >7. So 7 cannot be at pos6.

- If p3=7: then left neighbor pos2 must be >7 -> either 8 or 9 but 9 at pos1 only; we could place 8 in pos2, and right neighbor pos4 must also be >7 -> maybe 8? But duplicates not allowed. So cannot have both neighbors >7 because only one 8 available. Unless right neighbor is 9? but 9 already used at pos1; not adjacent to pos3 unless pos2=... Actually adjacency: if p3=7, its left neighbor pos2 could be 9 (since 9 at pos1 doesn't count). Wait 9 at pos1; pos2's neighbor left of it is pos1. But for 7 at position3, left neighbor pos2 cannot be 9 because 9 not at pos2. So only possible >7 values are 8 (unique). We would need both neighbors to be >7 which can't happen because we have only one number 8 >7 besides 9, but 9 is not adjacent to pos3 if pos1=9 and pos2 unknown; pos3's left neighbor is pos2 not pos1. So 7 cannot be at position3.

- Similarly p4=7 would require neighbors at positions3 and5 both >7. Only one >7 available (8) can't have both sides >7 unless 8 used twice impossible. So p4 cannot be 7.

- p5=7 would need pos4 and pos6 both >7 -> again impossible due to only one >7 left.

Thus the only possible location for 7 is at position2 with neighbor pos3 = 8. Let's confirm: If p2=7, then left neighbor pos1=9 (>7) good; right neighbor pos3 must be >7 (since need both sides). Only 8 qualifies, so pos3 must be 8.

Thus we set p2=7 and p3=8.

Now digits remaining for positions4-6: {4,5,6}. Because we've used 7,8.

We also know constraints for 5: neighbors >5. So if we place 5 in any of these positions (4,5,6), its left neighbor must be from {6,?} and right neighbor from {6}? Wait >5 includes 6 only since 7,8 already used; but 9 not adjacent except pos2 maybe; but for position4, left neighbor is pos3=8 which qualifies >5; right neighbor at pos5 will need to be >5 -> must be 6. So if we set 5 at pos4, then pos5 must be 6.

If 5 at pos5, neighbors: pos4 and pos6 both must be >5. But only number >5 left is 6 maybe? We would need two numbers >5; impossible.

If 5 at pos6, right neighbor pos7=2 (<5) fails. So 5 cannot be at pos5 or 6; must be at pos4 with pos5 = 6.

Let's set: p4 =5, p5 =6.

Check neighbors:

- p4(5): left neighbor pos3=8 (>5), right neighbor pos5=6 (>5). Good.

- p5(6): no constraint but has neighbors 5 and 2; fine.

Remaining digit left for position6: we used digits: {9,7,8,5,6,2,3,1}. The only remaining number is 4. So p6=4.

Check consistency:

Permutation: [9,7,8,5,6,4,2,3,1]

We should verify all constraints:

- Each digit 1-9 present? yes.
- 5 between two larger numbers: neighbors 8 and 6 (both >5) good.
- 3 between two smaller numbers: neighbors 2 and 1 (<3) good.
- 7 between two larger numbers: neighbors 9 and 8 both >7 good.
- First number is 9; last is 1 correct.

Thus sign reads "978564321"? Wait arrangement: 9,7,8,5,6,4,2,3,1. So the sign says 978564321? But we have digits at positions: 1:9 2:7 3:8 4:5 5:6 6:4 7:2 8:3 9:1 -> 9-7-8-5-6-4-2-3-1 -> "978564321". Yes.

Thus answer: the sign reads 978564321.

# Answer

The only arrangement that satisfies all of the clues is  

\[
9\,\;7\,\;8\,\;5\,\;6\,\;4\,\;2\,\;3\,\;1
\]

So the fog‑covered sign reads **978564321**. 

*Explanation:*  

- 9 and 1 must occupy the ends.  
- 3 must be surrounded by two smaller numbers, so it has to sit next to 2 and 1 – which forces it to be in position 8 with 2 at position 7.  
- 5 must have larger neighbours, so it can only go where both sides are 6–8 (the only digits >5 left). This places 5 in position 4 with 8 on the left and 6 on the right.  
- 7 needs two larger neighbours; the only possibility is 9 on the left and 8 on the right, putting it at position 2.  

With 9,7,8,5,6 fixed, the remaining digits 4 and 2 fill positions 6 and 7 (but 2 already occupies position 7). Hence the last remaining digit, 4, goes to position 6.

The completed sequence is \(9\,7\,8\,5\,6\,4\,2\,3\,1\), which matches all given conditions.
