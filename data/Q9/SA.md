According to statement 1, we have and only have 9 numbers from 1 to 9, and we need to figure out their orders on the sign.
Well, part of the sign has already been given in statement 5.
Let's put it down:

>9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1

Next, let's check the remaining statements:

- Statement 2: 5 is between two larger numbers, so candidates are 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Statement 3: 3 is between two smaller numbers, so candidates are 1 and 2.
- Statement 4: 7 is between two larger numbers, so candidates are 7 and 8.

Statement 3 and 4 can lead to two subsequences immediately, as their candidates are quite limited: [1, 3, 2] and [7, 8, 9], or their reverse orders.
However, 9 is fixed at the left end, and 1 is fixed at the right end, so their reverse orders ([9, 7, 8] and [2, 3, 1]) are correct.
Let's put them in place:

>9 7 8 _ _ _ 2 3 1

Now, the remaining numbers are 4, 5, and 6.
The last statement is statement 2.
However, all candidates in statement 2 have already been placed, except number 6.
Because there is only one usable candidate, we have to reuse numbers which have already been put down to surround number 5.
Looking at the partial sequence we have above, it is clear that number 5 must be put right after number 8, and 6 follows 5, thus making 5 surrounded by candidate 6 the reused 8.

> 9 7 8 5 6 _ 2 3 1

Finally, putting the last remaining number 4 in place, we have the final answer:

> 9 7 8 5 6 4 2 3 1
