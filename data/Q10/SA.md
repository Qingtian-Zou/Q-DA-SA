We need to figure out the positions of six cards. For simplicity, let's assume:
>a b c\
d e f

Let's look at the conditions.

Condition 1: The sum of the numbers on the top row must be one less than the sum of the numbers on the bottom row. This means that the sums of the top row and bottom row are two continuous numbers, and 1+2+3+4+5+6=21. Are there two continuous numbers that add up to 21? Yes, 10+11=21. Therefore, a+b+c=10, and d+e+f=11.

Condition 2: The two cards in the right column must add up to five. c+f=5. We have two possible pairs for this: 1+4=5 or 2+3=5. However, considering condition 4, the 1 card cannot be used in the right column. Therefore, the cards in the right column are 2 and 3, though it is not clear which one is on the top at this moment.

Condition 3: The 5 card must be to the immediate left of the 4 card. To be able to place the 5 card to the left, the 4 card can only be placed in the middle or right column. However, based on what we deduced from condition 2, 4 cannot be in the right column, so the 4 card must be in the middle column, 5 is in the left column of the same row, and 1 is in the left column of the other row so that condition 4 can be met.

Now, remember what we deduced of condition 1: each row's sum must be 10 or 11. In the row of 4 and 5, the only two possible numbers to add to this row is 1 (so the sum is 10) or 2 (so the sum is 11), but we have already decided that 1 is in another row. Therefore, only 2 can be used, which makes this row's sum to be 11, so this row is the bottom row:
>1 _ _\
5 4 2

The rest is easy. According to condition 2, c+f=5, and we already have f=2, so c=3. The last number b=6:
>1 6 3\
5 4 2

Finally, let's check it against all conditions:
1. (5+4+2)-(1+6+3)=1. Condition 1 is satisfied.
2. 3+2=5. Condition 2 is satisfied.
3. The 5 card sure is to the immediate left of the 4 card. Condition 3 is satisfied.
4. The 1 card sure is in the left column. Condition 4 is satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is:
>1 6 3\
5 4 2
