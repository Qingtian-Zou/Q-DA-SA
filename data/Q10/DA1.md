# Thinking

We need arrangement 3x2? Actually initial layout: top row three cards (positions: top-left, top-middle, top-right). bottom row same positions.

We must reorder numbers 1-6 into this grid satisfying conditions:

Let positions: (r,c):
(1,1)=a, (1,2)=b, (1,3)=c
(2,1)=d, (2,2)=e, (2,3)=f

Constraints:
1. sum top row a+b+c = one less than bottom sum d+e+f. So a+b+c + 1 = d+e+f.

Total sum of all numbers 1..6 is 21. So d+e+f = 21 - (a+b+c). Thus condition: (a+b+c)+1 = 21-(a+b+c) => 2(a+b+c)=20 => a+b+c=10. Then bottom row sum =11.

Thus top row must sum to 10, bottom row sum 11.

2. Right column cards are c and f: they add up to 5. So c+f=5.

3. The 5 card must be to the immediate left of the 4 card. Means positions adjacent horizontally? Immediately left means 4 is right of 5 in same row. So 5 at column 2, 4 at column3 maybe? Wait immediate left: "5 card must be to the immediate left of the 4 card" meaning 5 immediately left of 4 (so 5 at a position directly left to 4). Could also be vertical adjacency? Usually left-right. So positions horizontally adjacent. In same row.

So possible pairs: (column1, column2) or (col2,col3). 5 must be left card, 4 right card. So either 5 in col1 and 4 in col2 of the same row; or 5 in col2 and 4 in col3 of the same row.

Additionally we have condition 4: The 1 card must be placed in the left column (column1). So a or d =1.

Let's search possibilities.

We need top row sum 10, bottom sum 11. Right column sum 5: c+f=5.

Also each number 1-6 used once.

Let's brute reasoning manually.

Let’s denote positions:

Top row: a b c
Bottom: d e f

Given a or d =1 (left col). Let's test possibilities.

Case 1: top-left a =1. Then bottom-left d must be something else not 1.

Now we need to assign numbers 2-6 among other positions.

We need top row sum=10 => b+c =9 (since a=1). So b+c=9.

Also right column c+f=5 => f=5-c.

Since numbers 2..6, possible pairs (c,f) such that c+f=5: possibilities: (2,3), (3,2), (1,4)? But 1 already used. (4,1) can't because 1 used. So only options: c and f are 2&3 or 3&2.

Thus {c,f} = {2,3}. So c either 2 or 3; f the other.

Then b must satisfy b + c =9 => b = 9 - c. If c=2 => b=7 impossible (b must be 4-6). Not possible. If c=3 => b=6. That works: b=6, c=3, f=2.

So we have:

Top row: a=1, b=6, c=3
Bottom row: d=?, e=?, f=2

Sum bottom row must be 11; d+e+f =11 => d+e +2 =11 => d+e=9. Remaining numbers are {4,5}. But 4 and 5 sum to 9 indeed. So d=4,e=5 or vice versa.

But need condition 3: 5 must be left of 4. Where are 5 and 4? They are in bottom row positions: (2,1)=d, (2,2)=e. Condition 5 must be to immediate left of 4. So if d=5,e=4 -> 5 left of 4 satisfied because column1 left of column2. That arrangement works.

Check condition 3 also? It says "the 5 card must be to the immediate left of the 4 card." If 5 at (2,1) and 4 at (2,2), indeed 5 left of 4. Good.

Now verify all constraints: top row sum 10; bottom row sum 11; right column c+f =3+2=5; 1 in left column (a=1); 5 immediate left of 4 (d=5,e=4). All satisfied.

Thus solution:

Top: 1 6 3
Bottom:5 4 2

Check positions: (top-left)1, top-middle 6, top-right 3; bottom-left 5, bottom-middle 4, bottom-right 2.

But wait right column is top-right c=3 and bottom-right f=2 sum to 5 correct. Good.

Thus arrangement works. Might also be other solutions if we had d=1? Let's quickly test case 2: bottom-left d=1. Then left column has 1 at bottom row. Then top-left a cannot be 1. We need top row sum 10: a+b+c =10. Also right column c+f=5.

Numbers remaining 2-6 for other positions except maybe f. Let's brute quickly.

We know c+f=5 again only {2,3} pairs.

If c=2,f=3; then b = 10 - a - c. We have remaining numbers: {4,5,6?}. Actually after using d=1 and c=2,f=3, remaining numbers for a,b,e are {4,5,6}. Must sum: a+b+e = remaining total sum of those numbers? Let's compute bottom row sum: d+e+f = 11 => 1 + e +3 =11 => e =7 impossible. So case invalid.

If c=3,f=2 then b =10 - a -3. Remaining numbers for a,b,e are {4,5,6}. Then 1+e+2 =11 => e=8 impossible. So no solution with d=1.

Thus only valid arrangement is as found earlier: top row 1 6 3; bottom row 5 4 2.

Let's craft final answer clearly.

Also note that we might present as grid:

Top: [1] [6] [3]
Bottom: [5] [4] [2]

Or mention all constraints satisfied.

# Answer

The only way to satisfy all four conditions is

```
Top row:  1   6   3
Bottom:  5   4   2
```

**Check of the conditions**

| Condition | Verification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **1.** Sum of top‑row = \(1+6+3=10\).<br>Sum of bottom‑row = \(5+4+2=11\).<br>Bottom sum is one more than top sum. | ✔︎ |
| **2.** Right‑column cards are 3 and 2: \(3+2=5\). | ✔︎ |
| **3.** The card “5” (bottom‑left) is immediately left of the card “4” (bottom‑middle). | ✔︎ |
| **4.** Card “1” occupies a left‑column position (top‑left). | ✔︎ |

All six numbers 1–6 are used exactly once, and every requirement is met. Thus the arrangement above is the unique solution.
