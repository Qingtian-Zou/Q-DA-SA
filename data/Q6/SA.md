The shop owner does say strange things: Green is not green.
Also, note that the initials of "Blue" and "Black" are capitalized in sentences 1 and 4, even though they appear in the middle of sentences.
In the last line of the question, the initial of "White" is also capitalized.
Perhaps they are names, but not colors.
For example, from the grammar's point of view, "the red cat is next to the blue cat" might be a "correct" rephrase of the first statement.
However, both "Red" and "Blue" are used without articles in the original statement, and their initials are capitalized.
This sure seems to be the pattern of names but not simply colors.
The question has already provided the cats' positions when they are referred to by their colors.
If the cats' names match their colors, there is no point in asking such an obvious question.

For short, let's use R for the cat named Red.
Similarly, Bk, G, Be and W stand for cats named Black, Green, Blue, and White, respectively.
Now, keeping the capitalized initials in mind, the five statements can be rephrased as follows:
- "R is next to Be."
- "Bk is not white."
- "G is not green."
- "Be is three over from Bk."
- "R is on the end."
We also have the cats' arrangements of their colors: red, blue, green, black, and white.
Now let's consider how to map the names to their colors and positions.

The last statement seems to be a good start: R is on the end.
This means that it should either be the one colored red or white.
Next, the first statement also mentions R.
"R is next to Be."
However, because R is already on the end, there is only one position for Be.
If R is red, then Be must be blue; if R is white, then Be must be black.
Then, for Be, the relevant statement is statement 4: "Be is three over from Bk."
If Be is blue, then Bk must be white; if Be is black, then Bk must be red.
However, according to statement 2, the former assumption cannot be true.
Therefore, R is white, Be is black, and Bk is red.
Finally, the only two cats left are W and G, and the colors left are blue and green.
According to statement 3, G cannot be green, so G is blue, and W is green.

Therefore, the cat named White is the green-colored cat in the middle.
