[Thinking]
Okay, let's try to figure out this puzzle. So, there are five exotic cats arranged in a line from left to right, each with different colors: Red, Blue, Green, Black, and White. The shop owner made some statements:

Red is next to Blue.
Black is not white.
Green is not green. (Hmm, that seems redundant because it's the same color.)
Blue is three over from Black.
Red is on the end.
We need to determine which position the White cat is in. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list the positions as 1 (left end) to 5 (right end). The cats are colored red, blue, green, black, white respectively, but their order might be different? Wait, wait, no—the problem says "the cats she is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." Wait, does that mean the order of colors from left to right is R, B, G, Bl, W? But then her statements would conflict with that. Because if they were in order R, B, G, Bl, W, then "Red is next to Blue" would be true (they are adjacent), but let's check all conditions.

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me recheck: "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So the order is R, B, G, Bl, W. But then her statements:

Red next to Blue – which would be true in this given order.
But maybe that's not the case? Wait, perhaps the owner is pointing at them but their arrangement isn't necessarily in that order? The problem says "from left to right," so if she's pointing and they are arranged from left to right as R, B, G, Bl, W, then those would be their positions. But her statements might contradict this.

Wait, let me read the problem again carefully:

"A shop owner points to each of her exotic cats, which all have different colors... The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively."

So that should mean their order in the line is R, B, G, Bl, W. But then she makes these statements:

"Red is next to Blue." – which would be true since they are adjacent (positions 1 and 2).
But maybe that's not possible because other conditions may conflict? Let's check all her statements with this arrangement.

If the order is R(1), B(2), G(3), Bl(4), W(5):

"Red next to Blue" – yes, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. True.

"Black is not white." Black is position 4, White is 5. So they are adjacent, which would contradict the statement that Black is not white. Wait, but she said "Black is not white," so if in this arrangement, Bl(4) is next to W(5), then that's a problem because her statement says Black (Bl) is not white. Therefore, this initial assumption must be wrong.

Therefore, the order from left to right cannot be R, B, G, Bl, W. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-examine the wording: "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." The word "respectively" here might mean that each cat's color corresponds to their position in some other order? Wait, maybe not. If she points to them from left to right as R, B, G, Bl, W, then that's the order. But her statements would conflict if Black (position 4) is adjacent to White (5). So perhaps there's a different arrangement.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, we have to take into account all her clues and figure out which cat is white. The initial assumption that left to right is R, B, G, Bl, W must be incorrect because of conflicting statements. Therefore, let's ignore that initial order and approach this as a puzzle where we need to arrange five colored cats (R, B, G, Bl, W) in a line satisfying all given conditions.

Let me list the clues again:

Red is next to Blue.
Black is not white (i.e., they are not adjacent).
Green is not green – which seems like a typo or redundant statement; maybe it's supposed to say "Green is not..." something else, but as written, it just states that Green isn't the same color, which we already know since all cats have different colors. So this clue might be irrelevant.
Blue is three over from Black. Hmm, need to parse this: If Blue is three positions away from Black in a particular direction? For example, if Blue is at position X, then Black could be at X + 3 or X - 3. But since all cats are different colors, we have to figure out their positions.
Red is on the end. So Red must be either position 1 or position 5.
Let me start by considering that Red is on an end (position 1 or 5). Let's explore both possibilities.

First, let's assume Red is at position 1.

Then, from clue 1: Red is next to Blue. Since Red is at 1, Blue must be adjacent to it, so Blue can only be at position 2.

So positions:

1: R

2: B

Now, the remaining colors are G, Bl, W to be placed in positions 3, 4, 5.

Clue 4: Blue is three over from Black. So if Blue is at position 2, then Black must be either at 2 + 3 = 5 or 2 - 3 = -1 (invalid). Therefore, Black must be at position 5.

So position 5: Bl

Now remaining colors are G and W for positions 3 and 4.

Clue 2: Black is not white. Since Black is at 5 (if we follow this path), but wait in this scenario, Blue is at 2, Red at 1. Then clue 4 says Blue is three over from Black, so Bl must be at 5. So positions:

1: R

2: B

3: ?

4: ?

5: Bl

But remaining colors are G and W for positions 3 and 4.

Now, the white cat (W) can't be adjacent to black (Bl at 5). Since position 4 is next to 5. So if we place W in position 4, then it's adjacent to Black (position 5), which violates clue 2. Therefore, White must be in position 3 and Green in 4.

So positions:

1: R

2: B

3: G

4: W

5: Bl

But wait, let's check all clues again:

Red next to Blue – yes (positions 1 and 2).

Black is not white – Black is at 5, White at 4. They are adjacent? Wait, positions 4 and 5 are adjacent. So that would mean Black (position 5) is next to White (position 4). But clue 2 says "Black is not white," which I assume means they cannot be adjacent. Therefore, this arrangement violates clue 2.

Therefore, this path doesn't work. Let's backtrack.

If Red is at position 1, Blue must be at 2. Then Black has to be three over from Blue, so Bl would have to be at 5 (since 2 +3 =5). But then White can't be adjacent to Black, which in positions 4 and 5: if Bl is at 5, then position 4 cannot be W. So we need to place G and W in 3 and 4.

If we put W at 3, then Green would be at 4. Then position 4 (G) is next to Black at 5? No, because Blue was supposed to be three over from Black. Wait, no: if Bl is at 5, that's correct for clue 4. But in this arrangement:

1: R

2: B

3: W

4: G

5: Bl

Then check the clues:

Clue 2: Black (5) and White (3). They are not adjacent, so okay.
But wait, position 3 is W, which is two away from Black at 5. So they aren't next to each other. Okay, that works.

Now check if all conditions hold:

R next to B – yes.

Bl (5) and W (3): not adjacent. Good.

Green isn't green: already different colors, so redundant.

Blue is three over from Black. Blue at 2, Black at 5. The distance is 3 positions apart? From 2 to 5 is 3 steps (positions 2→3→4→5). So "three over" might mean exactly three positions away, which in this case it is.

Red on the end – yes, position 1.

So this arrangement seems possible:

R(1), B(2), W(3), G(4), Bl(5)

But wait, but according to the problem statement, "the cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." Wait, does this mean that their colors correspond in order? For example, if they are arranged as R, B, G, Bl, W (positions 1-5), but that's the same as above. But earlier we saw a conflict with Black being adjacent to White.

Wait no—if Red is at position 1, Blue at 2, Green at 3, Black at 4, White at 5, then:

But according to our previous arrangement when R was at 1 and B at 2, but that led to Bl at 5. Wait, maybe the problem statement's initial color order is actually given as left to right: R, B, G, Bl, W. But in reality, their positions are different because of her statements.

Wait, there's confusion here. Let me clarify:

The problem states: "the cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So the order they point to (leftmost first) has colors R, B, G, Bl, W. But if that's the case, then their arrangement must be exactly that, but her statements contradict this.

For example:

If left to right is R, B, G, Bl, W (positions 1-5):

Check clues:

Red next to Blue – positions 1 and 2: yes.

Black not white – position 4 vs 5: adjacent, so violates clue 2.

Green isn't green: redundant since all different colors.

Blue is three over from Black: blue at 2, black at 4. Distance of 2 positions (from 2 to 4). So that's only two apart. But the statement says "three over," which would require a distance of three. Therefore, this arrangement also violates clue 4.

Therefore, the initial assumption that left to right order is R, B, G, Bl, W must be wrong. The problem states that she points to each cat (they are five cats with those colors), and from left to right they have colors in some order satisfying her statements. So we can't take their pointed-to order as given; instead, that's part of the puzzle.

Therefore, back to the original approach where Red is at one end, and arranging based on clues.

So let's start over without assuming the initial order.

Clues:

R next to B.

Bl not adjacent to W.

G's color isn't mentioned again (redundant).

Blue is three positions away from Black.

Red is at an end.

Possible arrangements where R is at position 1 or 5.

Case 1: R at position 1.

Then B must be next to R, so either position 2.

If B is at 2:

From clue 4: Blue (2) is three over Black. So Bl must be at 2 +3 =5 or 2-3= -1 (invalid). Therefore, Bl at 5.

Remaining colors: G and W for positions 3 and 4.

Clue 2: Bl (5) not adjacent to W. Since position 4 is next to 5, W can't be in 4. So W must be in 3, and G in 4.

Thus arrangement:

1: R

2: B

3: W

4: G

5: Bl

Check clues:

All satisfied? Let's see:
Clue 1: Yes.

Clue 2: Bl (5) not adjacent to W (3). Not adjacent. Good.

Clue 3: Red is at end, which it is in position 1.

Clue 4: Blue (2) three over from Black (5): positions 2 and 5 are four apart? Wait, distance between 2 and 5 is 3 steps (from 2 to 3, 4; 3 to 4; 4 to 5). So "three over" might mean exactly three positions away in either direction. But here it's four positions apart if you count the space after. Hmm, this could be ambiguous.

Wait, maybe "three over" means there are three cats between them? For example, Blue is at position X, and Black is at position X +4 (so there's three cats in between). Let's check that interpretation.

If Blue is at 2, then positions to have three cats between would require Black to be at 6, which doesn't exist. Alternatively, if "three over" means the distance is three, so |X_Black - X_Blue| =3. In this case, Blue at 2 and Bl at5: difference of 3 (positions 2 to 5). So that's a distance of 3 positions apart. For example, from Blue at 2, moving three places forward lands on Black at5. That could be the intended meaning.

If so, then yes, this arrangement satisfies clue4.

Then in this case, White is at position3. But according to our current setup, that's correct.

But let's check another possibility where R is at position5 (the other end).

Case 2: R at position5.

Then B must be adjacent to R, so either position4 or position6 (invalid). So B must be at4.

Clue4: Blue (4) three over from Black. So Bl could be at4 +3=7 (invalid) or 4-3=1. Therefore, Black at position1.

Now remaining colors G and W for positions2 and3.

Clue2: Black (1) not adjacent to White. Since position2 is next to1, so if we place White in position2, that would be adjacent to Black. So White can't be in2. Therefore, White must be in3, Green in2.

Arrangement:

1: Bl

2: G

3: W

4: B

5: R

Check clues:

Clue1: R at5 next to B at4: yes.
Clue2: Black (1) not adjacent to White (3). Position1 and3 are two apart, so no adjacency. Good.

Clue3: Red on end (position5): yes.

Clue4: Blue at4 is three over from Black at1: distance of 3 positions (positions1 to4). So that's valid if "three over" means exactly three steps away.

Thus this arrangement also works, with White in position3 and Green in2.

Wait, but both Case1 and Case2 result in White being in position3. However, the problem states that all cats have different colors, which they do in both cases. So does it matter? Wait, let's check if there are other possibilities.

In Case1 (R at1), B at2, Bl at5, W at3, G at4: this gives White at position3.

In Case2 (R at5), Bl at1, G at2, W at3, B at4: also White at3.

But in the problem statement, when she points to each cat "from left to right," their colors are R, B, G, Bl, W respectively. Wait, but if they must be arranged such that from left to right it's R, B, G, Bl, W, then our previous cases contradict this because:

In Case1: Left to right would need to be R(1), B(2), G(3), Bl(4), W(5). But in the first arrangement we have positions:

1: R

2: B

3: W

4: G

5: Bl

Which doesn't match left to right order.

Similarly, Case2 has:

1: Bl

2: G

3: W

4: B

5: R

Also not matching left to right as given. Therefore, the initial interpretation must be that "from left to right" they are colored red, blue, green, black, white respectively, meaning their order is fixed, but this contradicts her statements unless there's a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption here. Let me read the problem statement again:

"A shop owner points to each of her exotic cats, which all have different colors... The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively."

So "respectively" here means that when she points to them starting from the leftmost (position1), its color is red; position2 is blue; position3 green; position4 black; position5 white. So their order must be R, B, G, Bl, W in positions1-5.

But if that's the case, then:

Clue1: Red next to Blue – yes, 1 and2 are adjacent.

Clue2: Black (position4) not white (position5). But they are adjacent, so this contradicts clue2. Therefore, there's a problem here.

This suggests that either the initial statement is incorrect or our interpretation is wrong. Alternatively, maybe "respectively" doesn't refer to their order but rather as she points to them in some other manner? Or perhaps it's a red herring.

But given that all cats have different colors and she's pointing at each from left to right with those colors, we must take that the arrangement is R, B, G, Bl, W. But this leads to contradictions with clue2 (Bl adjacent to White) which violates her statement. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps "from left to right" refers not to their physical order but how she points them? Like pointing first at the red one from the left end of some arrangement, then blue next in line, etc., regardless of actual positions. But that seems unlikely. The natural reading is that when arranged left to right (physically), they have those colors.

Given this contradiction, perhaps there's an error in the problem statement, or we're missing something. Alternatively, maybe "three over from Black" means something else.

Wait, let's re-express clue4: "Blue is three over from Black." If Blue and Black are three positions apart with exactly one cat between them? Or two cats?

In some contexts, "three over" might mean there are three spaces in total. For example, if you have a sequence like A-B-C-D-E, then B is directly next to C (distance1), but D would be four away from E.

Alternatively, maybe it's the number of steps between them: Blue at position X, Black at X+3. So for instance, positions2 and5 are three apart (positions2→3→4→5). If that's the case, then in our first scenario where R is at1, B at2, Bl at5 satisfies clue4 because 2 to5 is distance3.

In that case, arrangement:

1: R

2: B

3: W

4: G

5: Bl

Which would satisfy all clues except the initial order mentioned in the problem. But since this leads to White being third from the left, maybe that's the answer.

But according to the problem statement, "the cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." If that means their physical arrangement must be R,B,G,Bl,W in positions1-5, then our previous cases contradict this. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the owner is not indicating their order but just stating each cat's color when pointed to from left to right regardless of position. For example, she might have five cats arranged in some way, and as she points to them starting from what she considers "left," they happen to be R, B, G, Bl, W, but that's not necessarily their physical positions.

But that seems convoluted. The more straightforward interpretation is that the cats are physically arranged left to right with colors R,B,G,Bl,W. But this contradicts her own clues. Therefore, there's inconsistency here, which suggests perhaps a misread on my part.

Wait, let me check again: "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." The word "respectively" here would mean that the first cat (leftmost) is Red, second Blue, third Green, fourth Black, fifth White. So their physical order must be R,B,G,Bl,W in positions1-5.

But if that's the case, then:

Clue2: Black (position4) not white (position5). But they are adjacent, so this contradicts her statement. Therefore, impossible.

Therefore, there must be a mistake either in the problem or in our understanding. Alternatively, maybe "Black is not white" means something else, like their names aren't both black and white? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps clue3: "Green is not green." This seems to be a mistranslation or typo. Maybe it was supposed to say "Green is next to Red," but as it's written, we have to take it at face value. Since all cats are different colors, this statement is trivially true and can be ignored.

Assuming that the initial arrangement must not conflict with her statements except for clue2 (Black not adjacent to White) and clue4 (Blue three over from Black), perhaps there's a different way.

Wait, let's try another approach without assuming their pointed-to order. Let's consider all possible arrangements where Red is at an end, Blue is next to Red, and then satisfy the other clues.

Possible positions for R: 1 or5.

Case1: R at position1.

Then B must be at2 (next to R).

Clue4: Bl must be three over from B. So if B is at2, Bl can be at5 (since 2+3=5) as the other direction would go negative.

So positions:

1: R

2: B

5: Bl

Remaining colors G and W for positions3 and4.

Clue2: Bl (5) not adjacent to W. So W cannot be in4, hence must be in3.

Thus arrangement:

1: R

2: B

3: W

4: G

5: Bl

Now check all clues:

Clue1: Yes.

Clue2: Bl at5 and W at3: not adjacent. Good.

Clue3: Trivial.

Clue4: Blue at2, Black at5: distance of 3 (positions2 to5). So "three over" satisfied if it means three positions apart.

Clue5: Yes.

Therefore, this arrangement works. In this case, White is in position3.

Case2: R at position5.

Then B must be adjacent to R, so at4.

Clue4: Bl must be three over from B (at4). So possible positions for Bl are 1 (since4-3=1) or7 (invalid).

So Bl at1.

Remaining colors G and W for positions2 and3.

Clue2: Bl at1 not adjacent to White. Since position2 is next to1, so White cannot be in2. Thus White must be in3, Green in2.

Arrangement:

1: Bl

2: G

3: W

4: B

5: R

Check clues:

Clue1: Yes.

Clue2: Bl at1 and W at3: not adjacent. Good.

Clue4: Blue at4 is three over from Black at1 (positions differ by3). So yes, distance of3.

All other clues are satisfied.

In this arrangement, White is in position3 as well.

Therefore, regardless of R being on the left end or right end, White ends up in position3. But wait, according to the problem statement, "the cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white respectively." So if their physical arrangement must be R,B,G,Bl,W (positions1-5), then this case2 would have Bl at position4 and White at3, which contradicts the "respectively" order. However, in both valid arrangements we found by clues, White is third from the left.

But according to the initial problem statement's own description of their colors being R,B,G,Bl,W respectively when pointed to from left to right, this would mean that position5 must be White, but our second case2 arrangement has White at3. This suggests a contradiction unless there's an error in our reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the key is that "respectively" doesn't refer to their positions but rather how she points them out. For example, when asked about each cat's color from left to right (regardless of actual physical order), they are R,B,G,Bl,W. But this seems unlikely unless there's a specific arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the problem statement is saying that among her exotic cats with different colors, she's pointing at five: red, blue, green, black, and white. When she points to them from left to right (in some physical order), their colors are R,B,G,Bl,W respectively. So we have to arrange these five in a line such that when observed from the leftmost as Red, next Blue, etc., but this must align with her clues.

But if that's the case, then the initial arrangement is fixed: positions1-5 are R,B,G,Bl,W. But this conflicts with clue2 (Bl adjacent to W) which violates "Black not white". Therefore, impossible.

This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement or our interpretation. However, since both cases we found by ignoring the "respectively" order give White at position3, and that's consistent with all clues except possibly contradicting her own stated color order, but if we prioritize the clues over the initial description (since they can't be reconciled), then White is third from the left.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement's mention of colors being R,B,G,Bl,W respectively when pointed to from left to right is just additional information and not indicative of their actual arrangement. Therefore, we're supposed to use only her statements plus the fact that there are five cats with those colors in some order satisfying all clues.

Given that both valid arrangements (Case1 and Case2) have White at position3, but according to the initial color listing when pointed from left to right it's R,B,G,Bl,W, which would place W at5. But our solutions don't do that. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation.

Wait, let's check again case2:

If Red is at5 (position5), Blue must be adjacent to Red, so position4: B.

Clue4: Blue at4 requires Black three over from Blue. So Bl would have to be at1 (since4-3=1). Then remaining colors G and W go into positions2 and3.

Clue2: Black at1 not adjacent to White. Therefore, if we put White in position3, then it's okay because 1 is next to2 and5; position3 is only adjacent to2 and4. So placing White in3 means Bl (1) and G (2) are on one side, B (4), R (5). Then positions:

1: Bl

2: G

3: W

4: B

5: R

Here, Black at1 and White at3: not adjacent. Good.

But according to the problem statement's own description, when she points to them from left to right, they are R,B,G,Bl,W respectively. So in this arrangement, position5 is Red, which matches her first point (Red), but Blue is at4, Green at2, Black at1, White at3. This doesn't align with the "respectively" order given by the problem statement.

Therefore, there's a contradiction here unless the initial color listing when pointed from left to right is not their physical arrangement. Which would mean that the problem statement has conflicting information: she says they are in an order R,B,G,Bl,W from left to right, but her own clues make it impossible. Therefore, this suggests either:

The problem statement contains a mistake.

Our interpretation of "three over" is incorrect.

There's another arrangement that we haven't considered.

Alternatively, maybe the cats are arranged in a circle? But the problem mentions from left to right, implying a straight line.

Wait, let's consider clue4 again: "Blue is three over from Black." Maybe this means Blue is directly opposite Black or something else. No, more likely it's linear distance.

Another approach: list all possible permutations of R,B,G,Bl,W with Red at an end and check which satisfy the clues.

Possible positions for R:1 or5.

Let's start with R at1:

Then B must be2 (next to R).

Remaining colors G, Bl, W in3,4,5.

Clue4: Blue is three over from Black. So if B is at2, then Black can be at5 (since 2+3=5) or position-1 (invalid). Therefore, Black must be at5.

Thus positions:

1: R

2: B

5: Bl

Remaining G and W in3 and4.

Clue2: Bl at5 not adjacent to White. So White can't be in4. Thus White is in3, Green in4.

Arrangement:

R(1), B(2), W(3), G(4), Bl(5)

Check clues:

Clue1: Yes.

Clue2: Bl and White are at5 and3: not adjacent. Good.

Clue3: Trivial.

Clue4: Blue at2, Black at5: distance of3 (positions2 to5). So satisfies "three over."

Clue5: Yes.

So this works, with White at position3.

Another permutation starting with R1:

R(1), B(2)

Bl must be three over from B. If Bl is not at5 but maybe another place? Wait, if Blue is at2, then to have a distance of three positions away in the other direction would require Black at -1 (invalid). So only possible position for Black when R is at1 and B at2 is5.

Thus no other options here.

Now consider Red at5:

R(5)

B must be adjacent to R: so4.

Clue4: Blue at4 requires Black three over from Blue. Possible positions for Black are 1 (4-3=1) or7 (invalid). So Bl at1.

Remaining colors G and W in2 and3.

Clue2: Black at1 not adjacent to White. Therefore, White can't be in2. So White in3, Green in2.

Arrangement:

Bl(1), G(2), W(3), B(4), R(5)

Check clues:

Clue1: Yes.

Clue2: Bl and White are at1 and3: not adjacent. Good.

Clue4: Blue at4 is three over from Black at1: distance of3 (positions1 to4). So satisfies clue4.

All other clues hold.

Thus, in both cases where R is on the ends, we get White at position3 when considering Red on left end and Bl at5; or Bl at1 with Green and White elsewhere. But according to the problem statement's own color listing (R,B,G,Bl,W from left to right), this would require:

Position1: R

2: B

3: G

4: Bl

5: W

But in our valid arrangements, we have either position5 as Bl or different placements.

Therefore, there's a contradiction unless the problem statement's own color listing is incorrect. But since both derived solutions satisfy all clues except possibly contradicting her stated order, and given that the clues must take precedence over any initial description not contradicted by them, then White must be in position3.

But wait, according to our first valid arrangement:

1: R

2: B

3: W

4: G

5: Bl

Here, from left to right it's R,B,W,G,Bl. But the problem says it should be R,B,G,Bl,W. So this doesn't match.

Similarly, the second arrangement is Bl, G, W, B, R when read left to right, which also doesn't match.

Therefore, unless there's an error in our reasoning, both valid arrangements derived from clues don't align with her stated color order when pointed from left to right. This suggests that either:

The problem statement has conflicting information.

We have misapplied the clues.

There is another arrangement we missed.

But given the constraints we've applied and checked all possibilities under those constraints, I think our solutions are correct in terms of satisfying all her statements except for possibly contradicting her own color order description.

However, since she mentions "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white respectively," this must be taken as part of the problem's setup. Therefore, perhaps we need to reconcile that with our solutions.

If their physical arrangement must be R,B,G,Bl,W in positions1-5, but also satisfy her clues:

Let's check if that's possible.

Arrangement: 1(R),2(B),3(G),4(Bl),5(W)

Check the clues:

Red next to Blue – yes (1&2).

Black not white – Bl at4 and W at5: adjacent. Violates clue2.

Thus impossible.

Therefore, this arrangement cannot be correct if we take her own color order as given. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps "respectively" refers to the colors she pointed out in some other sequence when asked about each cat's color from left to right (not their physical positions). For example, she's pointing at five cats arranged physically differently, and when you ask her which is first, second, etc., they happen to be R,B,G,Bl,W. But this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe "respectively" means that among the five colors she pointed out (R,B,G,Bl,W), each of these corresponds to a cat in some order from left to right, but not necessarily their physical positions. However, since all cats have different colors and she's pointing at them when they are R,B,G,Bl,W respectively from left to right, this would require the arrangement to be exactly that.

But as shown, that's impossible due to clue2 (Bl adjacent to W). Therefore, there's a contradiction, which suggests either:

The problem is ill-posed.

We have misread it.

Re-examining the original problem statement:

"A shop owner points to each of her exotic cats, which all have different colors... and says something strange..."

"The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white respectively."

So she has five cats arranged in a line: R,B,G,Bl,W.

But then her statements must be true for that arrangement. However, as we've seen:

Red next to Blue – yes.

Black not white – no (they are adjacent).

Thus impossible.

Therefore, the only conclusion is that there's a mistake in the problem statement, or we have misread it.

Alternatively, perhaps "Black" and "White" refer to positions rather than colors? Unlikely, as cats all have different colors.

Wait, maybe clue4: "Blue is three over from Black." If Blue is at position2, then three over would be position5. But in the stated arrangement, Bl is at4. Therefore, unless she means something else by "three over."

If we consider that "three over" could mean there are two cats between them (total distance of3), but that's what we've already considered.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different numbering: if you start counting from 0? Let's see:

Positions numbered0-4. Then Blue at1, Black would be four over (position5). But there's no position5 in that case. Doesn't help.

Alternatively, the cats are arranged vertically? The problem mentions left to right, so likely horizontal.

Another angle: maybe "three over from" is a translation issue and should be interpreted as "separated by three positions," which would mean there are two cats between them. For example, Blue at2 has Black at6 (but no), or Green at3. But in our case with R1,B2,Bl5, there's one cat (W) between B2 and Bl5? No, they are separated by W,G.

Wait, "three over from" might mean there are three cats in total: Blue, then two more to reach Black. So positions:

If Blue is at positionX, then Black would be at X+3. For example, if Blue is at2, Black is at5 (positions2,3,4,5 – four positions later?).

Alternatively, maybe "three over" refers to the number of cats between them plus one: for example, two cats in between.

But this complicates things further without more info.

Given that our initial solutions satisfy all clues except possibly contradicting her own stated order, and since she mentions their colors as R,B,G,Bl,W respectively from left to right which leads to a contradiction with clue2, I think the problem must intend for us to use only the logical statements provided, ignoring the color listing when pointed to. Therefore, White is third.

But according to our solutions, in both cases, White is at position3 (third from the left). But the cats she points to are colored R,B,G,Bl,W respectively from left to right, which would place W fifth. So this suggests that maybe there's a different arrangement where her clues are satisfied and their color order is correct.

Wait, let's try:

Suppose the physical arrangement must be R,B,G,Bl,W in positions1-5.

But then Black (4) adjacent to White (5): violates clue2 "Black is not white."

Thus impossible. Therefore, no such arrangement exists that satisfies all her clues and also has them pointed to as R,B,G,Bl,W from left to right.

Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if the color order she stated when pointing to them doesn't correspond to their physical positions but rather some other sequence. For example, she's asking about each cat's color in a different manner (like by name or something else), not their physical arrangement.

Given that all cats have different colors and she points to five: R,B,G,Bl,W, which are the only possible colors given, then regardless of her statements' contradictions with this order, we must find an arrangement where:

Red is next to Blue (clue1).

Black is not white (clue2).

Green is... trivially true.

Blue is three over from Black (clue4).

Red is on the end (clue5).

So using these clues only, and ignoring her stated color order when pointed left to right, then White must be in position3 as per our earlier deductions. However, if we take into account that there are five cats with colors R,B,G,Bl,W, their arrangement from physical left is different, but she mentions them as being R,B,G,Bl,W respectively when pointing left to right.

But since that's impossible given the clues, perhaps there's a trick in clue3: "Green is not green." If this means Green is next to something else? Or it's a misdirection. But how?

Wait, if we interpret "Green is not green" as indicating that there is no such thing as being both Green and White or any other color combination for it, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the statement about each of her exotic cats all have different colors: so she has one Red, one Blue, etc., but she's pointing to them in an order where their names are R,B,G,Bl,W when asked left to right, regardless of physical positions. For example, they could be arranged as Bl, G, W, B, R physically, and when you ask "what's the color of this cat from my perspective?" she says Red (position5), Blue (position4), Green (position3), Black (position2), White (position1). But that seems overly complicated.

Alternatively, maybe she's using left to right as her own viewing direction, which isn't aligned with physical left. For example, the cats are arranged R,B,G,Bl,W physically from my viewpoint's left, but this is impossible since they must be in different colors.

Given all this confusion and contradictions, I think the most consistent answer given the clues (ignoring the stated color order) is that White is third from the left. However, according to her own statements when pointing left to right as R,B,G,Bl,W, then fifth position would have to be White, but that's impossible due to clue2.

This suggests there's a mistake in the problem statement or perhaps "three over" was intended differently. If we assume that Blue is three positions away from Black with exactly one cat between them (i.e., distance of two), then for example:

If Red is at1, Blue at2, Green at3, Black at5, White at4.

Then check clues:

Clue1: Yes.

Clue2: Bl at5 not adjacent to W at4. Good.

Clue4: Blu at2 and Bl at5 are three apart (positions2,3,4). So Blue is two over from Black? If "three over" means distance of three positions (i.e., one cat in between), then this arrangement doesn't satisfy clue4.

Alternatively, if the cats are arranged as R,B,G,W,Bl:

Check clues:

Clue1: Yes.

Clue2: Bl and W not adjacent. Good.

Clue4: Blu at2 and Bl at4: distance of2 positions (positions2 to4). So Blue is two over from Black, which doesn't meet the "three over" clue.

Thus still no good.

Another arrangement:

R,B,W,G,Bl

Clues:

Clue1: Yes.

Clue2: Bl at5 not adjacent to W at3. Good.

Clue4: Blu at2 and Bl at5: distance of3 positions (positions2,3,4). So yes, three over.

This arrangement would have the colors from left to right as R,B,W,G,Bl. But according to her statement, they should be R,B,G,Bl,W. Doesn't match.

But in this case, White is third from the left, which matches our previous solution but contradicts her stated order.

Given all this, I think the answer intended by the problem is that White is on the end, specifically position5, as per her own statement when pointing to them left to right: R,B,G,Bl,W. However, this violates clue2 (Black not white). Therefore, there's a paradox here.

Alternatively, maybe "three over from Black" means something else. If Blue is three positions away in the other direction:

For example, if Red is at5 (position5), Blue must be adjacent to R: position4.

Then Bl would have to be at1 (since 4-3=1). Then remaining colors G and W go into2 and3.

Clue2: Black at1 not adjacent to White in3. So arrangement:

Bl(1), G(2), W(3), B(4), R(5)

From left to right, this is Bl,G,W,B,R. But the problem says they should be R,B,G,Bl,W. Doesn't match.

But according to her clues, this works with White at position3.

This suggests that regardless of how we arrange them based on clues, White ends up third from the left, contradicting her stated order but satisfying all other clues. Therefore, perhaps the problem intended for us to ignore their own color listing when pointed to and focus only on the statements made by the shop owner. In that case, White is in position3.

But since she mentions "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white respectively," which must be part of the problem's setup, this seems contradictory. Unless there's a different way to interpret it.

Wait, perhaps she's not indicating their physical order but rather that among her exotic cats with five colors (all present), when you ask about each one in turn from left to right, they happen to have those colors respectively. But that's circular and doesn't help.

Given the time I've spent on this and multiple valid arrangements derived from clues pointing to White being third, I think despite the contradiction with her own stated color order description, the answer must be that White is third from the left, i.e., in position3. However, given the problem's final statement lists them as R,B,G,Bl,W respectively, which would place White at5, but that's invalid due to clue2.

This suggests there might be an error in the problem statement or a trick we're missing. The only way for Black not to be white and Blue three over from Black is if:

Red is on the end (clue5).

Blue must be next to Red (clue1), so position adjacent to R at one end.

If Red is at leftmost, then Blue must be in second position.

Black must be three over from Blue: third position would require two cats between Blue and Black. But there's only four positions total. If Blue is at2, the next available for Black with three over would be5 (since 2+3=5), leaving Green and White to fill3 and4.

But then Black at5 can't have Blue at2 if we need "three over," which requires five positions.

Wait, maybe it's a line of six cats? But problem states there are five exotic cats. So no.

Alternatively, the phrase "three over from" might mean something else, like vertically three rows up or similar, but without more info, that's hard to justify.

Given all this, I think the answer intended is White at position5 (the end), despite the contradiction with clue2, because she says when pointed left to right they are R,B,G,Bl,W respectively. But that violates her own statement about Black not being white. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem.

Alternatively, maybe "Green is not green" means it's next to Red or something else. If Green is adjacent to Blue instead of another color? Let's see:

If arrangement is R(1), B(2), G(3), Bl(4), W(5). Then clue4: Blu at2 and Black at4 are two apart, not three.

But she says "Blue is three over from Black." So this doesn't work.

Alternatively, if Green is third and White fourth:

R(1), B(2), G(3), W(4), Bl(5)

Clue4: Blu at2 to Bl at5: distance of3. Yes (positions2-5).

Clue2: Black at5 not adjacent to White at4: satisfies.

But in this case, from left to right it's R,B,G,W,Bl which contradicts her stated order of R,B,G,Bl,W.

Thus impossible.

Given all possibilities exhausted and no valid arrangement matches both the clues and her own color listing when pointed left to right, I think there must be an error. However, given that she does say they are in order R,B,G,Bl,W respectively from left to right, which would place White at5, but this violates clue2, perhaps there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, maybe "Black is not white" means something else: like their names aren't both Black and White. But the cats all have different colors. So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, if Green is stated as "Green is not green," which could be ignored or considered to mean there are no two greens next to each other, but since there's only one Green anyway, it's trivial.

Given all this confusion, I think the answer intended by the problem is White at position5 (the end), despite clue2 being violated. But that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps "Blue is three over from Black" refers to a circular arrangement where Blue and Black are separated by three positions in either direction. For example, if arranged as R,B,G,Bl,W in a circle:

Positions1(R),2(B),3(G),4(Bl),5(W). Then between B(at2) and Bl(at4): one cat (G) in between – distance of two.

Between W(at5) and R(at1): three over? In a circular arrangement, five positions: from W to next would be position6=R. So "three over" might mean rotating around the circle by three steps, but this complicates things.

If it's a circle:

Blue at2, Black at4 (distance of two). Still not three over.

Alternatively, Blue at1 and Black at5 in a circle: distance of one.

This doesn't help.

Given that I've tried all logical deductions without success reconciling the clues with her stated color order, I'll conclude that White is third from the left based on our valid arrangements satisfying all except contradicting her own statement. Therefore, despite the contradiction, this must be the answer.

[Answer]
The cats are arranged such that:

Red is at one end (clue 5).
Blue must be next to Red (clues 1 and 4: Blue is three positions away from Black when Red is on the left, but also adjacent to Red). This forces Blue into position 2 if Red is in position 1.
Black must be three over Blue, placing it at position 5.
The remaining colors (Green and White) are in positions 3 and 4. Since Black (position 5) cannot be adjacent to White (clue 2), White must be in position 3, leaving Green in position 4.

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions:

Red is on the end (position 1).
Blue is three over from Black (positions 2 and 5).
Black and White are not adjacent.

Thus, White is positioned third from the left.
