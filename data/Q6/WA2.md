# Thinking

Okay, let's try to figure out this puzzle step by step. The shop owner has five exotic cats arranged in a line, each with a different color: Red, Blue, Green, Black, and White. The order from left to right is given as R, B, G, K (Black), W (White). Wait, no, the user says "the cats she is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So their positions are fixed: first is Red, second Blue, third Green, fourth Black, fifth White. But wait, that can't be right because then the statements would have to align with this arrangement. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I misread. The problem says "the cats she is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So their positions are in the order: Position 1: Red, Position 2: Blue, Position 3: Green, Position 4: Black, Position 5: White. But then she's making statements like "Red is next to Blue," which would be true here because they're adjacent (positions 1 and 2). Similarly, "Black is not white" – if black is position 4 and white is 5, that's correct. Then "Green is not green." Hmm, that statement doesn't make sense unless it's a typo. Wait, maybe the third point was mistyped. Let me check again.

The problem lists her statements as:

1. Red is next to Blue.
2. Black is not white.
3. Green is not green.
4. Blue is three over from Black.
5. Red is on the end.

Wait, statement 3 says "Green is not green." That seems contradictory because if a cat can't be two colors at once. So maybe that's just her saying that Green isn't next to another Green? Wait, but all cats have different colors. Maybe there's a typo here. Alternatively, perhaps it's supposed to say "Green is not next to Red" or something else. But as written, the third statement is confusing. Let me proceed carefully.

Assuming that each cat has only one color and they're arranged in order R, B, G, K (Black), W (White) from left to right. Let's check her statements against this arrangement:

1. "Red is next to Blue." In positions 1 and 2: yes, Red (1) is next to Blue (2). True.
2. "Black is not white." Black is position 4, White in 5. They are adjacent but different colors. So the statement "Black is not white" would be true because they aren't the same color; they're separate. But maybe the intended meaning was that their positions aren't next to each other? Wait, if black were next to white, then this statement would be false. But in the given arrangement, Black (4) and White (5) are adjacent. So "Black is not white" could mean they are different colors, which they are. Hmm, perhaps that's a valid interpretation.
3. "Green is not green." That seems odd. If Green is at position 3, this statement would be confusing. Maybe it's a typo for "Green is next to Black"? Or maybe she's saying that the color Green isn't placed where there's already a Green? But since all are different colors, that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps she meant "Green is not adjacent to Red," but that's just speculation.
4. "Blue is three over from Black." Let's see: Blue is in position 2. If you go three positions away from Black (position 4), that would be position 1 (if moving left) or beyond the end on the right. Wait, maybe "three over" means there are three cats between them? So if Blue is at 2 and Black at 4, there's one cat (Green) between them. But that's only one in between. The statement says "three over from," which might mean that counting includes both endpoints. Let me clarify: If Blue is three positions apart from Black, then the distance between their positions should be three. For example, if Blue is at 2 and Black at 5 (positions 2 and 5), that's three positions in between (3,4). Wait, but in our initial arrangement, Black is at position 4. So Blue at 2 and Black at 4: the number of cats between them is 1 (Green). That's only one cat in between. But she says "three over from," which might mean three positions away. Alternatively, maybe it's counted as steps where moving from Blue to next would be step by step. Let's calculate the distance between Blue (2) and Black (4): |4 - 2| = 2 positions apart. So that's two steps. If she means there's one cat in between, but she's saying three over... Hmm, perhaps this is a problem with the initial arrangement.

Wait, maybe my assumption that the order is fixed as R, B, G, K, W is incorrect because the statements need to be considered together. The user says "the cats she is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So that's their colors in positions 1 through 5: Red (1), Blue (2), Green (3), Black (4), White (5). But we need to check if this arrangement satisfies all her statements.

Let's go through each statement again with this initial assumption:

1. Red next to Blue: Yes, they're adjacent (positions 1 and 2). ✔️
2. Black is not white: They are different colors and in positions 4 and 5, so that's true. ✔️
3. Green is not green: Since each cat has a unique color, this statement might be redundant or possibly a typo. Assuming it's correct as written, maybe she's trying to say that the position of Green isn't conflicting with something else? Not sure. But since all are different colors, perhaps this statement is just irrelevant or there's an error here.
4. Blue is three over from Black: Let's see. If Blue is at 2 and Black at 4, the positions between them are 3 (Green). So there is one cat in between. The distance in terms of steps would be two moves (from 2 to 3 to 4). But she says "three over," which might mean three spaces apart. If so, then this statement isn't satisfied here because it's only two positions away. Therefore, the initial arrangement doesn't satisfy all conditions.
5. Red is on the end: Yes, position 1 is an end. ✔️

So problem lies with point 4. In the given arrangement, Blue (2) and Black (4) are two apart, which would mean "three over" isn't met. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about the order of colors in positions is incorrect.

Wait a minute! The user says: "the cats she is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So that's their color sequence as you go from leftmost (position 1) to rightmost (position 5): Red, Blue, Green, Black, White. But according to the statements, this arrangement doesn't satisfy all her points. Specifically, point 4: "Blue is three over from Black."

So we need to find an arrangement where:

- Each color is used once in some order.
- The leftmost cat is Red (from statement 5: "Red is on the end" – but there are two ends. Wait, wait! Hold on. Statement 5 says "Red is on the end." There are two ends: position 1 and 5. But according to the user's description, from left to right the colors are Red, Blue, Green, Black, White. So in that case, both ends would have different colors? Wait no: Leftmost is Red (position 1), rightmost is White (position 5). But statement 5 says "Red is on the end," which could mean it's either left or right end. If her initial arrangement has Red at position 1 and White at 5, then both ends have different colors. So maybe she's saying that one of the ends is Red. Wait, but according to the user's problem statement: "The cats she is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So that's their order as you go left to right: first Red, then Blue, Green, Black, White. Therefore, position 1: Red, 2:Blue,3:Green,4:Black,5:White.

But according to this arrangement, let's check statement 4 again: "Blue is three over from Black." In positions 2 and 4: the distance between them is two (positions). If "three over" means there are three cats in total between them, that would require Blue being at position x and Black at position y such that |y - x| = 3. Because if you have three cats between, then from Blue to first cat after Blue is one, second another, third the fourth (Black), so positions 2 to 5: that's four positions apart? Wait, maybe "three over" means there are two cats in between. For example, position x and y where there's a distance of 3, meaning |y - x| = 3. So Blue at position 1 and Black at position 4 would be three apart (positions 1,2,3,4: from 1 to 4 is difference of 3). Wait, no: positions are spaced by their order. Position numbers differ by the number of steps between them.

Wait, let's clarify what "three over" means. If Blue is at position x and Black is three over that would mean they are separated by three cats in total. So if you start counting from Blue's left neighbor as 1, then the next cat after that (position +2) would be two steps away. Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe "three over" means there are three positions between them. For example, Blue at position x and Black at position y where |y - x| = 3. So if Blue is in position 1, then Black would need to be in position 5 (since |5-1|=4). Wait, no, that's four apart. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the user intended that "three over" means there are three cats between them. For instance, positions x and y with y = x + 4 (so there's one cat after Blue's next position, then another, then Black). But in their initial arrangement, Blue is at 2 and Black at 4: that's two apart, so only Green in between.

But the statement says "Blue is three over from Black," which would require that there are three cats between them. So if there's one cat between them (as in positions 1 and 3), then they are one apart. If Blue is at position x, then for three cats between, Black must be at x + 4 (positions x to x+3 have the intermediate cats). For example, if Blue is at 2, Black would need to be at 6, which doesn't exist here. Alternatively, maybe "three over" means that when you move from Blue towards Black, there are three steps taken: so moving two positions away.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in terminology. Let me approach this systematically by considering possible arrangements where all statements hold true and see if it leads to White's position.

First, the cats must be arranged such that:

1. Red is next to Blue.
2. Black is not white (so they are different colors).
3. Green is not green (probably a typo or misstatement; maybe "Green is not adjacent to another color" but that's unclear).
4. Blue is three over from Black.
5. Red is on the end.

Assuming that statement 3 might have an error, perhaps it was meant to say something else like "Green is next to Black," but we can't be sure. Let's proceed with the given statements and see where they lead us.

First, since Red must be on the end (statement 5), so positions 1 or 5 are Red.

Let's consider both possibilities:

Case 1: Red is at position 1.

Then Blue must be adjacent to Red (statement 1). So possible Blues for Red (position 1): either position 2. Because if Red is at 1, the only cat next to it on the left would have no cats; so statement 1 implies that Blue is immediately to the right of Red in position 2.

Now, we need Blue somewhere such that it's three over from Black (statement 4). Let's note positions:

If R is at 1, B must be at 2. Now, let's assign K (Black) and W (White), G (Green).

From statement 4: Blue (position 2) must be three over from Black. So the distance between position 2 and Black's position should be such that there's a difference of three positions. Let's calculate possible positions for Black.

If B is at 2, then K needs to be either at 5 (since |5-2|=3). Because moving three positions away from Blue could mean two steps in one direction: if you go left, but position 2 can't go further left; so only right. So Black would need to be at position 5. But let's check:

If K is at 5, then W must be somewhere else. Wait, no—if Red is at 1, B at 2, G and W are left for positions 3 and 4.

Wait, let me try this arrangement step by step:

Positions: 1(Red), 2(Blue), 3(Green), 4(Black), 5(White).

Check statement 4: Blue (pos2) to Black (pos4): distance is 2 positions apart. So "three over" doesn't hold here. Therefore, this arrangement doesn't satisfy the fourth condition.

So if Red is at 1 and B at 2, then K cannot be placed in position 5 because |5 - 2| =3? Wait, no: from pos2 to pos5 is three positions apart (positions 3,4,5). So maybe "three over" means there are two cats between them. For example, Blue at 1 and Black at 4 would have Green in between (two cats), making it a distance of three. But if B is at 2, then to be three away from K, K must be at position 5 (since |5-2|=3). Let's check:

If R=1, B=2, and Black=5. Then the positions would be:

1: Red

2: Blue

3: Green

4: ?

Wait, but we need to place Black at 5? But then position 5 is White according to initial user info, which conflicts. Wait, no—the user's problem states that from left to right the colors are R, B, G, K, W. So positions 1-5 must be those colors in order. Therefore, we can't change their order; they have fixed colors but maybe different arrangement? Wait, wait! I think I've made a mistake here.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "The cats she is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So that means in positions 1 through 5, their colors are Red (1), Blue (2), Green (3), Black (4), White (5). Therefore, the order of colors by position is fixed. But her statements must be true based on this arrangement. However, when I checked earlier, some statements weren't satisfied.

But wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting "the cats she is pointing to." Does it mean that their positions are left to right as R, B, G, K, W, but the actual physical order can vary? No, because you point to them in a line from left to right. So if she's standing at the entrance looking into her shop which has five cats lined up, and she points to each one starting from the leftmost (Red) to the rightmost (White), then their positions are fixed as R(1), B(2), G(3), K(4), W(5). Therefore, we have to check if this arrangement satisfies all her statements.

Let me list them again:

1. Red is next to Blue: Yes, 1 and 2.
2. Black is not white: True, they're in positions 4 and 5, different colors.
3. Green is not green: Since each cat has a unique color, this statement seems redundant or possibly mistyped. Maybe she meant "Green is adjacent to another color," but given the current info, it's true vacuously because there's no other Green.
4. Blue is three over from Black: In positions 2 and 4, that's two apart. So not satisfied.
5. Red is on the end: Yes.

So statements 1,2,5 are okay, statement 3 is unclear but maybe acceptable, but statement 4 isn't met in this arrangement. Therefore, there's a contradiction unless my interpretation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps "three over" means three positions away in either direction. So if Blue is at position x, then Black could be at x + 3 or x -3. Let's check:

In the current arrangement (R,B,G,K,W):

Blue at 2: possible Blacks would be at 5 (2+3=5) which exists. But according to our fixed positions, K is at 4 and W at 5. So if Blue were at 2 and Black at 5, that satisfies "three over." However, in the given arrangement, Black is at position 4. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about the order of colors (R,B,G,K,W) from left to right is incorrect.

Wait a minute! The problem says: "The cats she is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." This means that when you look at them in a line from the leftmost (first point), their colors go R, B, G, K, W. So position 1: R, 2:B,3:G,4:K,5:W.

But according to this arrangement, statement 4 ("Blue is three over from Black") would require Blue at position x and Black at x+3 or x-3. In our case, Blue is at 2; so if there's a Black three positions ahead (to the right), it should be at position 5. But in reality, K is at 4. Therefore, this arrangement doesn't satisfy statement 4. Hence, there must be an error either in my understanding or in the problem setup.

Alternatively, maybe "three over" means that between Blue and Black, there are three cats in total. For example, if they were positions x and y with |y - x| = 3 +1 (since number of elements between is one less than distance). So for a distance of 4 apart, there's one cat in between. But the statement says "three over," which could mean that from Blue to Black, there are three cats plus oneself? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the owner made a mistake, but we have to find the correct arrangement based on all statements being true.

Let me try rearranging the colors while keeping Red at an end (statement 5) and satisfying statement 4.

Let's attempt Case 1: Red is at position 1. Then Blue must be adjacent to Red, so Blue can be in position 2.

Now, we need Blue (pos2) to be three over from Black. Let's denote positions:

R(1), B(2), ?, ?, ?

We have remaining colors: G, K, W for positions 3,4,5.

Statement 4 requires that the distance between Blue (2) and Black is such that there's a difference of 3 in their positions. So if Black is at position x, then |x - 2| = 3 → x = 5 or x = -1 (invalid). Therefore, Black must be at position 5.

But according to the initial problem statement, White is supposed to be at position 5. Wait, but in this case, if we place Black at 5, then White would have to go somewhere else. However, per the user's description, from left to right they are R,B,G,K,W (positions1-5). But maybe that's their color sequence regardless of order? No, because you point to them left to right as colors appear.

Wait, I'm confused here. Let me clarify:

The problem states: "The cats she is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So in the line from leftmost (first) to rightmost (last), their colors are Red, Blue, Green, Black, White. Therefore, each subsequent cat has the next color in that list: position1=R, pos2=B, pos3=G, pos4=K, pos5=W.

But this arrangement doesn't satisfy statement 4 ("Blue is three over from Black"). So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup? Or maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe "three over" means that there are two cats between them. For example, positions x and y where |y -x| =3 (so one cat between). But let's check:

If Blue is at 2 and Black is at 5: then there's Green in position3 and K in4. So from Blue to Black: positions2→3→4→5 – that's three steps, so four positions apart? Wait, no: the distance between pos2 and pos5 is |5-2|=3. If you count each step as moving to an adjacent cat, then it's 3 moves (from 2 to3 is one, 3 to4 another, 4 to5 third). So Blue at2 needs Black at position x where the distance is three steps away. That would mean positions like:

If B=1 and K=4: |4-1|=3.

But in our case, if Red must be on an end (position1), then maybe arranging differently.

Let me try a different approach. Let's list all possible permutations of R,B,G,K,W that satisfy the given conditions.

Conditions:

1. Red is next to Blue → They are adjacent.
2. Black and White are not adjacent (different colors).
3. Green's condition: unclear, but in our initial arrangement it's true because there's no other Green.
4. Blue is three over from Black → Distance between B and K must be 3 positions apart.
5. Red is on an end.

Let's consider possible placements for Blue relative to Black with a distance of 3.

Possible pairs:

- If Blue is at position1, then Black would need to be at position4 (since |4-1|=3). But if Red is already at position1, that's impossible because each color must appear once.

Wait, no: positions can have any colors as long as all are unique. Wait, but the cats' order from left to right has their colors in R,B,G,K,W. So we can't reorder them; they're fixed by her pointing direction. Therefore, this approach is invalid. The problem says "the cats she is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." This means that the order of colors as you go from leftmost to rightmost is R,B,G,K,W. So each position has a fixed color: pos1=R, pos2=B, etc. Therefore, we must check if this arrangement satisfies all statements.

But earlier analysis shows it doesn't because statement4 isn't met. Unless there's a different interpretation of "three over."

Wait, maybe "three over" means that there are three cats between Blue and Black, not counting themselves. So the number of cats in between would be 3, making their positions x and y with |y -x|=4.

For example, if B is at position1, K needs to be at position5 (since there's one cat after B: pos2, then another at3, third at4, fourth at5). So distance of four positions apart. But in our fixed arrangement:

B at2 and K at4: |4-2|=2 → only one cat between.

If we need three cats between them (distance of 4), B would have to be at1 and K at5. But pos1 is R, so that's not allowed because each color must appear once per position.

Alternatively, if the order can vary while keeping Red on an end, but that contradicts the initial statement about their left-to-right colors being fixed as R,B,G,K,W.

Wait, this suggests a contradiction in the problem's conditions. Either there's a misstatement or I'm misunderstanding something.

Alternatively, perhaps "three over" refers to numerical value rather than positions. For example, if Blue is at position2 and Black has number 5 (since 2 +3 =5), but that's just adding their numbers without considering order.

Wait, let's think differently. Suppose the cats are arranged in a line with positions numbered left to right as1 to5.

The statements:

- Red next to Blue → they must be adjacent.
- Black not white → different colors.
- Green is not green → maybe she's trying to say something else here; perhaps it's irrelevant or there's an error.
- Blue three over from Black → the numerical difference between their positions should be3. So |Blue_pos - Black_pos|=3.
- Red on the end → position1 or5.

Let's try possible arrangements:

Case 1: Red is at position1.

Then Blue must be adjacent, so in position2.

Now, find Black such that |Black_pos -2|=3 → Black can be at5 (since 2+3=5). So positions would be:

1:R, 2:B, ?, ?, K(5).

But then we have to place Green and White in positions3 and4. But according to the problem's initial statement, position3 is Green and position4 is Black. Wait, no—the user says "the cats she is pointing to... are colored red, blue, green, black, white respectively from left to right." So their colors must be R,B,G,K,W in order. Therefore, positions1=R,2=B,3=G,4=K,5=W.

But this setup doesn't satisfy statement4 because B(2) and K(4) are two apart, not three. Hence, contradiction.

Case 2: Red is at position5 (right end).

Then Blue must be adjacent to Red, so in position4.

Now, find Black such that |Black_pos -4|=3 → possible positions for Black would be1 or7 (invalid). So no solution here.

Alternatively, if "three over" allows negative differences: 4-3=1. But that's not meaningful.

Case3: Maybe the initial assumption is wrong and Red can be at both ends? No, because each end must have one color.

Wait, this suggests that there is no possible arrangement where all conditions are satisfied given the fixed left-to-right colors as R,B,G,K,W. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, maybe "three over" means something else. Let's consider alternative interpretations:

- Maybe "Blue is three over from Black" means that if you start counting at Blue and move three places to reach Black, passing through each cat. So for example, starting at position2 (Blue), moving left would be invalid since we can't go below1. Moving right: positions3 (Green),4 (Black). That's two steps away. Not three.

Alternatively, "three over" could mean that Blue is placed such that when you count three cats after Black's color to reach Blue. But this requires knowing where Black is first.

This seems like a dead end. Let me try constructing an arrangement manually while ignoring the initial left-to-right order and focusing on conditions:

We have colors R, B, G, K, W. Let's arrange them so that all statements hold:

1. Red next to Blue.
2. Black not white (so they're separated).
3. Green's condition: unclear.
4. Blue three over from Black.
5. Red is on the end.

Possible arrangement:

Let's place Red at position1. Then Blue must be adjacent, say position2.

Now, we need Blue (pos2) to have a distance of 3 from Black. Let's put Black at pos5 (since |5-2|=3). So positions would be R(1), B(2), G(3), K(4), W(5). Wait, but then Black is at position4 here if we follow the initial order. Hmm.

Wait, no—if we're not following the left-to-right color sequence and just assigning colors to positions based on conditions:

Let's try this arrangement:

1: R

2: B

3: G

4: K (Black)

5: W

But in this case, Blue is at2 and Black at4: distance of 2. Not three.

Alternatively, place Black at position5 (distance from Blue at2: |5-2|=3). So:

1: R

2: B

3: G

4: ?

5: K

But then we have to assign W somewhere. Wait, but all colors must be used once. If Black is at5 and White must not be next to it (statement2), so positions4 can't be White. Therefore:

Positions1:R, 2:B, 3:G, 4=W, 5:K.

Check statements:

- Red next to Blue: yes.
- Black (5) not white: they're separated by position4, good.
- Green is in pos3; statement3 unclear but okay.
- Blue at2 and Black at5: distance of3 → satisfies "three over."
- Red on end: yes.

But according to the user's initial statement, from left to right they are R,B,G,K,W. In this arrangement, it's still that order (R(1), B(2), G(3), K/W? No—position4 would be White and5 Black in my previous example, which conflicts with their stated left-to-right colors.

Wait, the user's problem says: "The cats she is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white respectively." So regardless of any arrangement we deduce, their positions must have these color names in that order. Therefore, pos1=R, pos2=B, pos3=G, pos4=K, pos5=W.

But this doesn't satisfy statement4. Hence, the problem as posed might be contradictory unless there's a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps "three over" refers to numerical count rather than positions. For example, if Blue's color number plus three equals Black's color number modulo 5? Unlikely, but possible. Alternatively, maybe she made a mistake in her statements.

Alternatively, the problem might have a typo, and statement3 is supposed to say "Green is next to Black," which would change things. Without more information, it's hard to proceed.

Assuming that there's a typo and we need to find an arrangement where:

1. R next to B.

2. K not W (they are separate).

3. G's condition resolved somehow.

4. B three over from K.

5. R on end.

Let's try again without the fixed left-to-right color order, but instead solving for positions 1-5 with colors assigned such that all conditions hold:

Place Red at position1.

Then Blue must be adjacent: pos2.

Now, need to place Black such that distance between B(pos2) and K is3. So possible Ks are at5 (pos2 +3=5).

Thus, arrangement could be:

1:R, 2:B, ?, ?, K(5).

Remaining colors G and W go into positions3 and4.

Statement2: K not next to W → position4 can't be W, so pos3=W and pos4=G? But then statement3 says "Green is not green," which might mean something else. Maybe she's saying Green isn't placed where there's already a Green, but since each cat has unique color, that's impossible. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to say "Green is next to Blue" or another relation.

Alternatively, if we place K at5 and W somewhere else:

1:R, 2:B, 3:G, 4:W, 5:K.

Check statements:

1. R next to B: yes.

2. K (pos5) not W: they are separate? No, in this arrangement, W is pos4, so they're adjacent. Thus violating statement2.

Therefore, invalid.

Another try: place Red at position1, Blue at2, Black at5 (distance3 from2), and assign G and W to positions3 and4 with K not next to White.

So:

1:R, 2:B, 3:G, 4:W, 5:K.

But here, K(5) is adjacent to W(4). Violates statement2.

Alternatively, swap W and G:

1:R,2:B,3:W,4:G,5:K. Still K next to no one except pos4 (G), so that's okay. But then positions3=W and4=G. Check statements:

- Red next to Blue: yes.

- Black at5 not White: W is at3, separated by G and B, which is fine.

- Green's condition unclear but maybe irrelevant here.

But according to the initial user's problem statement, from left to right they are R,B,G,K,W. So in this arrangement, it's still that order (R(1),B(2),G(3),K(5?), no—pos4=G, pos5=W). Wait, conflicting again.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the answer is White at position5, but given the contradictions, perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, let's look back at the original problem statement:

"The cats she is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white respectively."

So their positions must be in that color order. Hence, pos1=R, pos2=B, pos3=G, pos4=K, pos5=W.

But this arrangement doesn't satisfy statement4 ("Blue is three over from Black"), which requires B at position x and K at x+3 or x-3.

Given the fixed positions:

B at2, so to be three away, K must be at5 (since 2+3=5). But in our case, K is at4. Therefore, this setup doesn't work. Hence, there must be an error in the problem's conditions.

Alternatively, maybe "three over" means there's one cat between them, making their positions two apart (distance of1), which would mean Blue and Black are separated by one other cat. But that contradicts the statement saying "three over."

Wait, perhaps the term "over" is used differently here. If you say something's three over from another, it might mean it's placed three positions away in a circular manner? Unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the cats are arranged not in a straight line but on different levels or rows, and "over" refers to layers. But that's speculative.

Given that all logical arrangements based on fixed left-to-right colors don't satisfy statement4, perhaps there's a trick here. Let's think outside the box: maybe some cats have multiple positions? No, it's stated they are exotic cats pointed at from left to right in order.

Wait, another angle: "Green is not green" might be her trying to say that Green isn't placed where there's already a different color, but since all are unique, that's always true. So perhaps this statement is redundant or misleading. If we ignore it for now, can the other conditions suffice?

If Red is at1, Blue at2, Black at4 (as per fixed colors), then:

- R next to B: yes.

- K not W: they are different and separated by G, so okay.

- Statement3: redundant.

- "Blue is three over from Black": distance between2 and4 is2. So no.

Therefore, the only way statement4 holds is if Blue and Black are three apart in positions. Given fixed colors order R,B,G,K,W, this requires that B is at1 and K at4 (since |4-1|=3). But pos1 is Red, so that's impossible unless we can rearrange colors.

Wait, but the problem says "the cats she is pointing to... are colored red, blue, green, black, white respectively." This means their color sequence from left to right must be R,B,G,K,W. Therefore, any permutation would violate this condition. Hence, there's no valid arrangement under these constraints that satisfies all statements.

But the problem asks "which cat is White?" implying there is a unique answer. Given this contradiction, perhaps I made a mistake in considering statement3.

If we take statement3 as "Green is not adjacent to another Green," but since each color is unique, it's automatically true. Therefore, maybe statement3 is just filler or there's an error, and the real issue is statement4.

Assuming that all other statements are satisfied except for statement3 being a red herring, then perhaps we can ignore it and focus on statements1-4 and5.

Given that, let's try to find any arrangement where:

- Red is at an end (pos1 or5).

- R next to B.

- Blue three over from Black.

- Black not adjacent to White.

Let's attempt again without the fixed left-to-right color order. Wait, but according to the user's problem, their positions are fixed as R,B,G,K,W. So we can't reorder them.

This is perplexing. Maybe the answer is that there's no solution, but since the question asks "which cat is White," implying there is one, perhaps the intended arrangement is different.

Wait, let's try a different approach: ignore the initial left-to-right color order and assume she points to them in some other way. But the user explicitly says from left to right they are R,B,G,K,W.

Alternatively, maybe "three over" refers to numerical values rather than positions. For example, if Blue's position number plus three equals Black's position. So B at1: 1+3=4 → K at4. Then:

R(?, pos?) ... Wait, this is too vague.

Given the time I've spent and lack of progress, perhaps the intended answer is that White is in position5, as per the user's initial statement, despite the contradictions with some statements. But I need to verify once more.

If we force all conditions except maybe statement3:

R at1, B at2 (adjacent), Black at4 (three over from Blue: 2+3=5? No). Wait, if Blue is at2 and three over would be position5, but K must be there. But then W has to go somewhere else.

This suggests that there's no valid solution under the given constraints unless we disregard some statements. Given that statement4 is problematic in the fixed arrangement, perhaps the correct answer is White in position5, assuming the problem expects us to overlook the contradiction or there's a typo.

# Answer

The cats are arranged as follows from left (1) to right (5): Red, Blue, Green, Black, White. However, this initial setup doesn't satisfy all conditions. Reassessing:

- **Red must be on an end**: Position 1 is Red.
- **Blue adjacent to Red**: Placed next in position 2.
- **Black three over from Blue**: To satisfy a distance of 3 positions apart (positions), Black would need to be at position \(2 + 3 = 5\). However, the problem states the order as R, B, G, K, W. Adjusting for this constraint:
   - Position 1: Red
   - Position 2: Blue
   - Position 3: Green (satisfies "Green is not green" by uniqueness)
   - **Position 4** must be Black to maintain the original left-to-right order.
   - **Position 5** resolves as White.

Despite initial contradictions, adhering strictly to the given color sequence and resolving statement ambiguities leads to:

The white cat is in position \boxed{5}.
