# Thinking

We need to interpret puzzle. The owner points to each cat and says statements. We have given actual list of colors: left to right: red, blue, green, black, white. They ask "which cat is White?" Might be trick: answer: the fifth cat? But maybe something else: The statements might describe positions relative to each other.

We need deduce which cat is white from these clues, but we are given that sequence of colors as clue? Wait: The problem states: "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." That seems like they already tell us the order. But then ask: which cat is White? Maybe it's a trick question: They want to see if we read the story incorrectly.

However maybe there is misinterpretation: The statements correspond to the cats as he's pointing, but the order given (red, blue, green, black, white) might be wrong or may be an example. Let's parse puzzle: "A shop owner points to each of her exotic cats, which all have different colors, and says something strange:" Then list quotes.

Then "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So that's the actual mapping. So we know the order; but maybe question: "So, then, which cat is White?" It's trivial: the fifth cat. But perhaps it's a puzzle about logical statements being false? The owner might be telling some statements that are true or false? We need to deduce from clues which statement corresponds to which cat? Actually each line presumably refers to the current cat being pointed at.

So maybe the owner is pointing in order left-to-right and making remarks; the content may describe colors of other cats. So we could determine which cat is white by logic rather than given list. But they provide list as part of puzzle: it's a clue. The question is simple? Let's examine each statement:

1) "Red is next to Blue." Means that in the lineup, red and blue are adjacent.

2) "Black is not white." Means black is different from white (obvious since all colors distinct). But maybe it implies black cannot be white cat; trivial. Could mean black color is not white? Eh.

3) "Green is not green." That seems impossible because green always equals itself. So that statement is false. Maybe the owner is making some statements true and others false, indicating something about cats.

4) "Blue is three over from Black." Means blue is 3 positions to the right of black? Or left? Over means difference in position =3. That would put blue at index black+3 or black-3.

5) "Red is on the end." Means red cat is at either leftmost or rightmost.

Now given that all colors distinct and sequence is red, blue, green, black, white. Let's test statements:

Positions: 1=red,2=blue,3=green,4=black,5=white.

Check #1: Red is next to Blue: yes (positions 1&2 adjacent). Good.

#2: Black is not white: true because colors differ; also black cat position 4 vs white cat pos5; statement is true.

#3: Green is not green: false (green equals itself). So false.

#4: Blue is three over from Black: positions difference: blue at 2, black at4 diff=2, not 3. So false.

#5: Red is on the end: yes (position1). True.

So statements 1,2,5 true; 3,4 false. So owner points to each cat and says strange statements that are partially true/false. Perhaps the rule is that statements about color relationships reflect the position of current cat? Actually maybe each statement refers to cat currently pointed: For each cat in order, the owner speaks something referencing other cats relative positions or colors.

We can deduce from statements which cat is white by solving constraints.

We have 5 cats, all distinct colors. Let positions p1..p5 unknown. We know there is a red, blue, green, black, white somewhere.

Constraints:

- For each i=1..5, the cat at position i has color C_i.

Owner says statement S_i about colors relative to positions or other colors? But statements 1-5 correspond to each cat as they are pointed. So we need to assign each statement to a particular cat's turn (maybe sequential). The given list of statements likely already in order of pointing: first cat, second cat,... So statement 1 corresponds to the leftmost cat; #2 to second; etc.

Thus we need to find which position has white color based on statements referencing positions or colors. But we are also given that all colors distinct and cats left-to-right are red, blue, green, black, white respectively - but maybe that's just telling us what answer is? Or maybe it's part of the puzzle: The owner says statements; then after reading them, you can deduce order of colors. They give an example solution? Wait they say "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." That might be the final answer. Then question: "So, which cat is White?" The answer: Fifth cat. But that seems trivial.

Maybe it's a lateral puzzle: The statements are nonsense but actually encode letters: e.g., Red = R, Blue=B etc. Might form message? "R is next to B", "B not W" etc. Maybe decode?

Let's interpret as cryptogram: Each statement referencing colors may hint at positions relative to each other. For instance, red is next to blue -> implies R adjacent to B.

Black is not white -> implies black cannot be white (true). But maybe indicates color of cat pointed is black? Wait the cat pointed says something strange; that cat might be black? Actually statement "Black is not white" could mean the cat being pointed at is black and he says Black is not white. That would make sense if he points to black cat. But we don't know.

Similarly, "Green is not green": If pointing at green cat, they say it's not itself: weird but true? Actually statement false. So maybe he points to green cat and makes false statement. That could be clue that he's lying about the color of the pointed cat? Let's check each:

If the first cat is red: He says "Red is next to Blue." That's a factual claim about lineup, not about himself.

Second cat is blue: He says "Black is not white" - a factual claim about colors.

Third cat green: He says "Green is not green" - false.

Fourth cat black: He says "Blue is three over from Black." (blue at pos? difference 3). Actually if he is black cat at pos4, statement false (diff2). Fifth cat white: He says "Red is on the end" - true. So statements 1,2,5 true, 3 and 4 false.

Maybe rule: When pointing to cat that is not the one referenced in statement? Wait each statement references other colors not current cat.

Thus maybe we just need to answer trivial question: White cat is fifth from left (rightmost). But perhaps there is trick: They purposely give order then ask which cat is white; but we need to respond "the last one" or "the fifth cat."

Maybe the puzzle's point is about ambiguous pronoun? Wait: The first statement: "Red is next to Blue." That could refer to red cat being next to blue cat. So red cat and blue cat are adjacent.

Second: "Black is not white." Means black cat is different from white cat; trivial but maybe indicates they are not adjacent? No.

Third: "Green is not green." That's obviously false, so something about this cat may be lying.

Fourth: "Blue is three over from Black." Means blue cat is 3 places away (either direction) from black cat.

Fifth: "Red is on the end." Means red cat at one of ends.

Now from these constraints we can deduce arrangement. Let's solve general puzzle: Unknown positions. Colors R,Bg? Actually B for blue, G for green, K for black, W for white (white). Need to place 5 distinct colors in order such that:

1) Red adjacent to Blue.
2) Black not White (i.e., no adjacency? But statement only says black is not white; but that's always true if all colors different; maybe means black cat cannot be same color as white cat which is trivial. Could mean "black is not next to white"? ambiguous.

3) Green is not green: false; So the statement about green is false. That could imply that the cat being pointed at is green and it's saying a false statement, so the rule may indicate something about liar? But we don't know.

4) Blue is three over from Black: distance between blue and black is 3 positions.

5) Red on end: Red is either first or last.

We need arrangement of 5 such that constraints hold. Let's assume constraints are facts about lineup (i.e., all true). Then check if any arrangement possible:

Let positions indices 1-5.

Constraint A: R adjacent B.
Constraint C: distance between B and K is 3.
Constraint E: R at end.

Let's enumerate possibilities.

If R at position1. Then B must be pos2. Distance between B (pos2) and K must be 3, so K could be pos5 or pos? difference=3 => pos5 or pos-1(not). So K at pos5.

Now left color positions: G and W remain for positions3&4 in some order.

Check constraints: all good. No constraint about adjacency between black and white? only "Black is not white" trivial but fine.

Now statement 3 "Green is not green" false - maybe doesn't impose constraints.

Thus arrangement consistent: pos1 R, pos2 B, pos3 G or W, pos4 remaining color, pos5 K. Wait we placed K at pos5; leaves G & W for pos3,4. But we also need to satisfy all statements? The statement about "Blue is three over from Black" we satisfied because difference between pos2 and pos5 =3.

Also "Red on the end": yes pos1.

Thus arrangement: [R,B,G,W,K] or [R,B,W,G,K].

Now check if any other arrangement possible? R at pos5. Then B must be pos4. Distance between B(4) and K is 3 => K could be pos1 or pos7 (not). So K pos1. Then positions left: G & W for 2&3 in some order. Arrangement [K,G,W,B,R] or [K,W,G,B,R].

Which arrangement matches all statements? Both satisfy constraints.

Now we need to pick one based on statement 3 being false? Suppose when pointing at green cat, he says "Green is not green" which is a false statement. That might happen only if the cat at position of green says that; but he's always speaking something strange regardless. So maybe no extra constraint.

Thus puzzle ambiguous; but they provide order: red, blue, green, black, white. That corresponds to first arrangement [R,B,G,W,K]? Wait we had K at end. But in given list, last cat is white not black. So our arrangement doesn't match.

Let's test other possibility: Maybe "Red on the end" means rightmost? If R at position5, then B pos4. Blue 3 over from Black: distance between B (pos4) and K? Actually B refers to blue; we had Blue pos4; K must be pos1 or pos7 -> pos1. So arrangement [K,...,B,R]. That yields positions: pos1 black, pos2 ?, pos3 ?, pos4 blue, pos5 red.

Now "Red is next to blue" holds if blue adjacent to red? But we have B at pos4 and R pos5 => adjacent yes. Good. The given order: [K,G,W,B,R] or [K,W,G,B,R]. But given list: red, blue, green, black, white. That would be R,B,G,K,W.

Our arrangement doesn't match; but maybe puzzle statement giving order is incorrect? Wait they said "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So indeed cat1=red, cat2=blue, cat3=green, cat4=black, cat5=white. That satisfies constraints? Let's check all statements again for truth values:

1) Red next to Blue: yes.
2) Black not White: true (different colors).
3) Green is not green: false.
4) Blue is three over from Black: positions diff 2 -> false
5) Red on end: position1 at left end => true.

So statements: true, true, false, false, true. So there are 3 true statements and 2 false. Might be pattern? Maybe rule that if statement references cat being pointed is the color itself (like "Red is next to Blue" references red), then it's always true? Actually only 1st true; 5th true but referencing red again.

Maybe the puzzle intends: Which cat is white? It's the fifth. But maybe trick: The owner says "Red is on the end." Could be ambiguous if there are two ends. But they say which cat is White? So answer: The cat at the rightmost position (since the other cat leftmost is red). Actually the phrase "on the end" might refer to right side; but we know from arrangement that red at left end, white at right end. So White cat is at the right end.

Thus final answer: The fifth cat from left, or the one on the right-hand side.

I'll craft final response accordingly.

But maybe they want reasoning using statements and deduction rather than reading given list. But we can produce explanation: Using statements, we deduce positions: Red must be an end; adjacent to Blue; Blue is 2 away from Black (difference3? Wait "Blue is three over from Black" -> difference of 3). That leads to arrangement R,B,G,W,K? Actually earlier we found two possibilities. Additional clue maybe about false statement indicates green cat at position 3 because the cat with false statement? If green cat says "Green is not green", that is false; so green cat at pos3, then from adjacency red next to blue: if red pos1 B2, or red pos5 B4 etc. Let's try arrangement R,B,G,W,K as given earlier but we had K last but statement 4 false indicates distance wrong? But maybe "three over" could mean "over" meaning number of cats between? If "Blue is three over from Black" means there are exactly two cats in between? Wait difference=3 positions: e.g., if black pos1, blue pos5 diff4 -> not 3. Hmm.

Let's compute distance for arrangement R,B,G,W,K:

Positions: 1R,2B,3G,4W,5K. Distance between Blue (pos2) and Black(pos5)? Wait black at pos5? Actually K=black. So blue pos2, black pos5 difference =3 positions? 5-2=3 indeed diff=3. So statement holds true! Wait earlier we said diff=2 but wrong because B pos2, K pos5 diff3. Yes correct.

Thus arrangement matches all statements: #1 red next to blue yes; #4 blue is three over from black (pos2->pos5 diff3) true; #2 black not white true; #3 false; #5 red on end true. So all true except 3.

Thus the list of colors as given indeed satisfies constraints with exactly one statement false (#3). That seems plausible.

So answer: White cat is rightmost (fifth from left).

I'll write final explanation accordingly.

# Answer

**The white cat is the fifth one – the cat on the far right.**

Here’s how we get that:

| Position | Statement | Color at that position | Does the statement hold? |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | “Red is next to Blue.” | **Red** | Yes, the blue cat is immediately to its right (position 2). |
| 2 | “Black is not white.” | **Blue** | Yes – black and white are distinct colors. |
| 3 | “Green is not green.” | **Green** | No – the statement is false; that’s the only false one. |
| 4 | “Blue is three over from Black.” | **Black** | Yes, the blue cat (position 2) is exactly three places to the left of the black cat (position 5). |
| 5 | “Red is on the end.” | **White** | Yes – red occupies the left‑most position, so it is indeed at an end. |

The only way all the true statements can be satisfied simultaneously is with the order

```
Red – Blue – Green – Black – White
```

Thus, the cat that is white is the one at the rightmost end of the row – the fifth cat from the left.
