# Thinking

Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a shop owner with exotic cats of different colors: red, blue, green, black, and white. The shop owner points to each one from left to right, but the order isn't given yet—wait, no, actually, the problem says "the cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." Wait, hold on. Wait, that might be confusing.

Wait, let's read again carefully:

"A shop owner points to each of her exotic cats, which all have different colors, and says something strange:

- 'Red is next to Blue.'
- 'Black is not white.'
- 'Green is not green.'
- 'Blue is three over from Black.'
- 'Red is on the end.'

The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively."

Wait, that last sentence says "the cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." Hmm. Wait, does that mean the actual order of the cats (left to right) is red, then blue, then green, then black, then white? But if that's the case, then the statements would have to be checked against this order.

But maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me parse the problem again.

So, the shop owner has a row of cats with different colors (red, blue, green, black, white). He points to each and says these things. Then it says "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." Wait, that seems like a statement about the actual order. Wait, but maybe this is part of the problem setup? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's a translation issue here or wording confusion. Let me re-read:

"A shop owner points to each of her exotic cats, which all have different colors, and says something strange:

- 'Red is next to Blue.'
- 'Black is not white.'
- 'Green is not green.'
- 'Blue is three over from Black.'
- 'Red is on the end.'

The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively."

Wait a second. The last sentence says "the cats he is pointing to... are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So does that mean that in reality (the actual order), the cats from left to right are red, then blue, etc.? But if that's the case, then we can check the statements. Wait, but the problem says "So, then, which cat is White?" Which suggests that the answer isn't given by the list? Hmm.

Wait, maybe the confusion comes from whether the last sentence is part of the problem description or a statement to be considered. Let's try to think.

Possibly, the problem is: There are five cats in a row (left to right), each with different colors: red, blue, green, black, white. The shop owner makes these five statements. Then we have to figure out which position white is in, given that the statements are true. However, the last sentence here says "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." Wait, maybe that's a misstatement?

Wait, perhaps this problem was translated or phrased awkwardly. Let me think.

Alternative approach: Maybe the problem is similar to some logic grid puzzles where you have positions 1-5 (left to right), colors red, blue, green, black, white. The shop owner makes those statements about their order, and we need to figure out where white is.

But in that case, the last sentence says "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." Wait, but if that's the actual order, then all the statements must be true or false? But the problem says "he points to each of her exotic cats... and says something strange". So maybe those five statements are clues, and we have to figure out the correct order.

But the last sentence is confusing. Let me try to parse it again.

Original problem: "A shop owner points to each of her exotic cats, which all have different colors, and says something strange:

- 'Red is next to Blue.'
- 'Black is not white.'
- 'Green is not green.'
- 'Blue is three over from Black.'
- 'Red is on the end.'

The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively.

So, then, which cat is White?"

Wait a second. If "the cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively", that would mean that the order is [Red, Blue, Green, Black, White] from left to right. But if that's the case, then we can check the statements against this.

Let's test:

1. "Red is next to Blue." In the given order: Red (pos1) and Blue (pos2), so yes, they are next to each other. This statement would be true.

2. "Black is not white." Black is at pos4, White at 5; they are different colors, so this statement is true.

3. "Green is not green." Wait, that's a paradox. Green is green, so saying "Green is not green" would be false. But the shop owner says "something strange"—maybe this is a clue that it's a lie? Hmm.

4. "Blue is three over from Black." If Blue is at pos2 and Black at pos4, then the number of positions between them: from 2 to 4 is two apart (positions 3 in between), so maybe "three over" means three positions away? Wait, terminology here might be tricky.

Wait, "Blue is three over from Black." If "over" means to the right or left. In some contexts, like "A is n over from B" could mean A is n positions to the right of B. But in a row of five cats:

If we have positions 1 (leftmost) to 5 (rightmost).

Suppose Black is at position X, then Blue is three over, so Blue is at X + 3? Or maybe |X - Y| = 3?

Wait, the statement says "Blue is three over from Black". Maybe in this context, it's saying that there are three cats between them? Or Blue is three positions to the right of Black.

But given that the problem states the order as red, blue, green, black, white (left to right), let's check each statement:

Given order: 1=Red, 2=Blue, 3=Green, 4=Black, 5=White

Statement 1: "Red is next to Blue." True, since they are adjacent.

Statement 2: "Black is not white." Black and White are different colors, so true.

Statement 3: "Green is not green." This statement is a contradiction; it's always false. So if the shop owner says this as a statement (i.e., truthfully), then it would be problematic because it's false. But he says "something strange"—maybe some statements are lies? Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify whether all statements are true or not.

Wait, this is confusing. If the problem states that the cats are in the order red, blue, green, black, white left to right, then we can see which statements hold. But statement 3 ("Green is not green") is false. So if all statements are supposed to be true (as clues), then this would be a problem because it's contradictory.

Alternatively, maybe that last sentence isn't stating the actual order but rather part of the problem description? Wait, no—the way it's written: "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So this seems like a statement about what the shop owner said? Or maybe it's mistranslated.

Wait, perhaps the original problem was in another language, and "respectively" here might be misplaced. Alternatively, maybe it's saying that when he points to each cat (i.e., his pointing sequence), the colors are red, blue, etc.—but not necessarily the order of the cats.

This is getting too confusing. Let me try to approach this as a logic puzzle where there are five positions, left to right (1-5), with colors red, blue, green, black, white each used once.

The shop owner makes these statements:

1. "Red is next to Blue." (i.e., Red and Blue are adjacent)

2. "Black is not white." (Black ≠ White; which is always true since all colors are different, so this might be redundant? Unless in the context of the problem, but probably just a clue that Black and White are distinct, which they are.)

3. "Green is not green." This seems like a lie or a paradox. If taken literally, it's false.

4. "Blue is three over from Black." Hmm. Depending on interpretation: Maybe Blue is three positions to the right of Black? Or there are three cats between them?

5. "Red is on the end." So Red is either first or last.

The question is: Which cat is White? (i.e., in which position?)

Given that, let's try to solve it with standard logic puzzle rules where all statements are true (assuming the shop owner is truthful—though statement 3 seems false). Wait, but "Green is not green" is a lie. So maybe some of these statements are lies? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says: "the shop owner points to each of her exotic cats... and says something strange". So he makes five statements that are odd or paradoxical. The key might be that some statements are lies because they're nonsensical (like statement 3 is a contradiction).

But in logic puzzles like this, usually all the given statements are true clues, but here statement 3 seems problematic.

Let's try to proceed with the assumption that all statements are true except possibly statement 3. Wait, no—if "Green is not green" is said by the shop owner, then if he's telling the truth, it would be a paradox. So perhaps this is a clue that Green is not in some position? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo or mistranslation. Let's try to ignore statement 3 for a moment because "Green is not green" is inherently false—it might be a red herring or a mistake in the problem.

Let's list the clues:

1. Red and Blue are adjacent.

2. Black ≠ White (but since all colors are different, this is always true; maybe it's redundant)

3. Green ≠ Green → False statement

4. Blue is three over from Black. Assuming "three over" means separated by two positions (i.e., with two cats in between), or three positions apart.

Wait, terminology here is key. In some contexts, like in games, "X is n spaces away" can mean the distance. If it's a row of five:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

If Blue is three over from Black, depending on direction. Maybe "three over" means three positions to the right? So if Black is at position x, then Blue is at x+3.

But given there are five positions, possible pairs:

For example, if Black is at 1, Blue would be at 4 (1 + 3 = 4)

If Black is at 2, Blue at 5

Black at 3: Blue would need to be at 6, which doesn't exist.

So only two possibilities for "Blue is three over from Black" (if interpreted as Blue is three positions right of Black): (Black=1, Blue=4) or (Black=2, Blue=5)

Alternatively, if it means there are three cats between them: so distance of 4. But with five positions max.

Wait, the problem says "Blue is three over from Black". Hmm.

In some contexts, especially in puzzles like this, "n over" can mean n steps away. Let's assume that "three over" means there are three positions between them, i.e., separated by three spots, so total distance of four? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use standard logic puzzle terms.

Let me try to model this.

We have 5 positions: 1 (leftmost), 2, 3, 4, 5 (rightmost)

Colors: R, B, G, Blk, W (Black and White; let's denote Black as 'K' for simplicity to not confuse with Blue)

Wait, maybe better:

Colors: Red (R), Blue (Bl), Green (G), Black (Bk), White (W)

We need to assign each color to positions 1-5.

Clues:

1. R is adjacent to Bl.

2. Bk ≠ W (which is always true since all colors are distinct; so this clue might be irrelevant or a trick)

3. G ≠ G → Contradiction, which suggests that maybe the statement "Green is not green" is false, implying something else? Not sure.

4. Bl is three over from Bk. Let's try to interpret this as Bl is at position = Bk's position + 3 (i.e., three positions to the right). So possible pairs:

If Bk is in position x, then Bl is in x+3.

Since max position is 5, x can be 1 or 2:

x=1 → Bl=4

x=2 → Bl=5

x=3 → Bl=6 (invalid)

Similarly, if it's three positions to the left: Bk = Bl +3, so Bl could be in 1→Bk=4; Bl=2→Bk=5. But "three over from" usually implies direction.

But given the problem says "Blue is three over from Black", probably Blue is three positions away from Black (in some direction), but need to figure out.

5. R is on the end → R is in position 1 or 5.

Given that statement 3 ("Green is not green") is a lie, perhaps all statements except maybe one are true? Or the problem assumes that only some statements are clues (the others might be nonsense). Hmm.

This is tricky. Let's suppose that statements 1,4,5 are true, and statements 2,3 are either trivial or false.

But statement 2: "Black is not white" – since all colors are different, this must be true, so it's a redundant clue.

Statement 3 is clearly false ("Green is not green"), so maybe the shop owner made a mistake here, but in logic puzzles like this, we usually take all clues as true. Hmm. This inconsistency might be key.

Wait, another thought: Maybe "Green is not green" is a mistranslation or misstatement for something else, like "Green is not [some other color]". But assuming the problem is given as-is.

Let's try to proceed with the following:

Assume statements 1,4,5 are true (as they give actual constraints), statement 2 is trivially true, and statement 3 is a paradox (so we can disregard it or use it as "Green is not in the position that would make this statement meaningful", but I don't know).

So:

Clue 5: R ∈ {1,5}

Clue 4: Bl is three positions from Bk. Let's tentatively take this as |Bl - Bk| = 3 (if "three over" means three apart in either direction). Wait, but in a row of five, the maximum distance between two positions is 4 (positions 1 and 5).

So |Bl - Bk| = 3.

Possible pairs:

(1,4), (2,5), (4,1), (5,2)

But since it's "Blue is three over from Black", maybe it's directional. If we take "three over" as to the right, then Bl = Bk +3.

As before: Bk=1 → Bl=4; Bk=2→Bl=5.

Clue 1: R and Bl are adjacent.

Let's try both possibilities for clue 4.

Case 1: Bl = Bk +3

Subcase 1a: Bk=1, Bl=4

Then positions:

Bk at 1, Bl at 4

Now, Clue 5: R is on the end (1 or 5). But position 1 is Black, so R must be at 5.

So R=5

Clue 1: R (5) must be adjacent to Bl (4). Yes, positions 4 and 5 are adjacent. Good.

Now we have:

1: Bk (Black)

2: ?

3: ?

4: Bl (Blue)

5: R (Red)

Remaining colors: G, W

Positions left: 2,3

So positions 2 and 3 must be Green and White.

Is there any other clue? Statement 2 is trivial. Statement 3 is nonsense.

Wait, but the problem says "the cats he is pointing to... are colored red, blue, green, black, white respectively". Wait, if in this case we have order [Black, ?, ?, Blue, Red], so not matching the given statement. Wait, maybe I misread the problem earlier.

Hold on! The original problem says: "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." Does this mean that when the shop owner points to each cat (i.e., his pointing sequence), the colors are in that order? Or is it saying that the actual arrangement is red, blue, etc.?

This is critical. If "The cats he is pointing to..." refers to the order of the cats from left to right being red, blue, green, black, white, then all the statements have to be evaluated against this fixed order.

But in that case:

Order: 1=R, 2=B, 3=G, 4=Blk, 5=W

Check the statements:

1. "Red is next to Blue." Yes (1 and 2 adjacent) – true

2. "Black is not white." Black is at 4, White at 5 – different, so true

3. "Green is not green." False

4. "Blue is three over from Black." Blue at 2, Black at 4. If "three over" means separated by two positions (i.e., distance of 3), then |4-2|=2, so not three apart. If it means three positions to the right: 2+3=5≠4; Black at 4 would be Blue's position minus 3? Not sure.

If "Blue is three over from Black" in this order: Blue is two positions left of Black (since Black is at 4, Blue at 2), so not three over. So statement 4 would be false here.

5. "Red is on the end." Yes, Red is at position 1 – true

So statements 3 and 4 would be false in this order. But the problem says "the cats he is pointing to... are colored red...", which suggests that this is the actual arrangement. But then why ask "which cat is White?" because it's given as white.

Wait, the question is: "So, then, which cat is White?" If the answer is simply the last one (position 5), but the problem says "the cats he is pointing to... are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively". So that would mean White is fifth. But this seems too straightforward, and given that statement 3 is false, maybe there's a trick.

But the problem might have been misstated. Alternatively, the last sentence is not saying the actual order but something else.

Wait, here's another angle: Maybe "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right..." refers to the order in which he made the statements? No, that seems unlikely.

Alternative interpretation: The problem is presented as a puzzle where you have five cats with colors red, blue, green, black, white (all different), arranged in some order left to right. The shop owner makes those five statements. Then it says "The cats he is pointing to..." but maybe mistranslated or misphrased.

Assuming that we need to find the position of White given the clues.

Let's try again with this approach.

We have five positions, 1-5 left to right.

Clues:

A. Red is next to Blue.

B. Black ≠ White (always true, so ignore)

C. Green is not green → This is a contradiction; perhaps indicating that Green is not in the position that would make it "green", but this is too vague. Maybe this clue is intended to be "Green is not [another color]", like a mistranslation.

D. Blue is three over from Black.

E. Red is on the end (position 1 or 5)

Let's focus on D: If "three over" means that there are three positions between them, i.e., four apart? Not likely in five positions.

Wait, another common phrasing: In some puzzles, "A is n places to the left of B" means A comes before B with n-1 cats in between. So "Blue is three over from Black"—if it's "three over", maybe Blue is three positions after Black (i.e., Black is at x, Blue at x+3).

As before:

Possible pairs for (Black, Blue): (1,4), (2,5)

Let's explore these.

First possibility: Black in 1, Blue in 4

Then clue E: Red is on the end → positions 1 or 5. Position 1 is Black, so Red must be at 5.

Clue A: Red (5) must be adjacent to Blue (4). Yes, 4 and 5 are adjacent. Good.

Remaining colors: Green, White for positions 2 and 3.

So order would be:

1: Black

2: ?

3: ?

4: Blue

5: Red

Now, what about clue C? "Green is not green." Hmm. Not sure how to apply this.

If we have to place Green in either 2 or 3, White in the other.

But there's no other constraints given (clue B is trivial). So unless clue C implies something else.

Wait, maybe statement C "Green is not green" is a lie, so the truth would be "Green is green", but since all cats have different colors, this might indicate that Green is a valid color here. Not helpful.

Alternatively, in some logic puzzles, paradoxical statements can be used to indicate something. For example, if someone says "This statement is false", it's a liar paradox. Here, the shop owner says "Green is not green"—which is inherently false, so maybe this clue tells us that Green cannot be placed somewhere? Not sure.

Assuming we have positions 2 and 3 as Green and White with no further constraints, then there are two possibilities.

But wait, let's check if there's another clue.

Wait, in the original problem statement: "the cats he is pointing to, from left to right..." If this phrase is part of the problem description meaning that we have to figure out that order, not given. Wait, I think confusion arises from the translation.

Let me try to look for similar puzzles.

In standard logic grid puzzles with five elements:

Given:

- Red is next to Blue.

- Blue is three apart from Black.

- Red is on an end.

We need to find positions.

Assuming "three apart" as |pos(Blue) - pos(Black)| = 3

As we thought earlier, possible pairs: (1,4), (2,5), (4,1), (5,2)

But let's consider direction. If it says "Blue is three over from Black", maybe Blue is to the right of Black by three positions.

So Black at x, Blue at x+3.

As before: Black=1→Blue=4; Black=2→Blue=5

Let's take first case:

Black=1, Blue=4

Red must be on end (position 1 or 5). Position 1 is Black, so Red=5

Then positions 2 and 3 are Green and White.

Now check adjacency: Red(5) is next to Blue(4), which satisfies clue A.

No other clues. So two possibilities for White: position 2 or 3.

But the problem asks "which cat is White?" implying a unique answer. Hmm.

Second case:

Black=2, Blue=5

Red must be on end (1 or 5). But Blue is at 5, so Red can't be at 5 (all colors different), so Red=1

Check adjacency: Red(1) needs to be next to Blue(5)? No, they are separated by positions. So this violates clue A ("Red is next to Blue"). Therefore, invalid.

So only the first case holds: Black=1, Blue=4, Red=5

Remaining positions 2 and 3: Green and White.

But we need another constraint. Wait, what about statement C: "Green is not green". If we interpret this as a clue that Green is not in a certain position... Not sure.

Wait, if the statement "Green is not green" is meant to be "Green is not [color] X", but mistranslated, maybe it's supposed to say "Green is next to White" or something else. But assuming it's as written.

Alternatively, since the problem says "the cats he is pointing to... are colored red, blue, green, black, white respectively", which might mean that in the solution, the order is R,B,G,Bk,W. But we saw earlier that in this order:

- Blue (2) and Black (4): difference of 2 positions; if "three over" requires a difference of 3, this wouldn't fit.

Wait, let's test this hypothetical order: [R, B, G, Bk, W]

Check all statements:

A. R next to B – yes

B. Black ≠ White – yes

C. Green is not green – false

D. Blue (2) is three over from Black (4). If "three over" means 3 positions away: |4-2|=2, so no.

E. Red is on end – yes

So this order satisfies A, B, E but fails C and D.

But the problem states that "the cats he is pointing to... are colored red...", suggesting this might be the intended order, but then why ask which cat is White? It would be the fifth one.

This is very confusing. Maybe the key is in statement 4: "Blue is three over from Black". If we interpret "three over" as three positions including itself or not.

Wait, another approach: In some contexts, especially in older puzzles, "n over" can mean n positions to the right. So if Blue is three over from Black, then Blue = Black +3.

As before, only possible with Black=1→Blue=4 or Black=2→Blue=5.

We saw that Black=2→Blue=5 leads to Red having to be at 1 (since Red must be on end), but then Red(1) needs to be next to Blue(5), which is not adjacent, so invalid. So only Black=1, Blue=4 works.

Then order starts with [Black, ?, ?, Blue, Red]

Remaining colors: Green, White for positions 2 and 3.

Now, here's a thought: The statement "Green is not green" might be a hint that Green is actually white or something else? No, the colors are all different.

Wait, no—if the shop owner says "Green is not green", it's a lie. If we assume all statements except one are true, but the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, this statement might indicate that the color Green does not exist in that position? Not sure.

Given that there are two possibilities for White (position 2 or 3), but the problem asks for a unique answer, I must have missed something.

Wait, going back to the original problem statement: It says "the cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." This seems like it might be saying that when the shop owner points to each cat (i.e., makes the statements), the colors in order are red, blue,... But no.

Wait, another idea: Maybe "the cats he is pointing to" refers to the order of his statements? Like he pointed to Red first, then Blue, etc. But not sure.

Alternatively, this entire problem is a trick question because statement 3 ("Green is not green") is always false, so it's a lie, meaning that Green is actually... Wait, but all cats have different colors.

Wait, if "Green is not green" is a lie, then the truth would be "Green is green", which is trivial. Not helpful.

Wait, let's consider that maybe in this problem's context, "three over from" means something else. For example, in some puzzle contexts, numbers can refer to positions where "1st, 2nd..." so "three over" might mean third position.

But not sure.

Wait, let's think differently. If we have to assign the colors:

From clue E: Red is on end (position 1 or 5)

Clue A: R adjacent to Bl

Clue D: |Bl - Bk| = 3 (assuming "three over" as three apart)

Let's list all possibilities.

Case 1: R=1

Then from clue A, Bl must be in 2

From clue D: |Bl - Bk|=3 ⇒ |2 - Bk|=3 ⇒ Bk=5 or Bk=-1 (invalid). So Bk=5

Check if possible:

Positions:

1=R, 2=Bl, 5=Bk

Remaining colors: G, W for positions 3,4

Does this work? Let's see.

Order: R, Bl, ?, ?, Bk

Clue D satisfied (distance of 3 between 2 and 5)

Now, what about clue C ("Green is not green")? Doesn't help.

But does this order violate any clues?

Statement 4: Blue (position 2) is three over from Black (position 5). If "three over" means distance of 3, then yes, |5-2|=3. So maybe this interpretation works.

In this case:

Positions 3 and 4 are Green and White.

Is there any constraint left? Statement 3 still doesn't help.

So two possibilities here as well: White could be in 3 or 4.

But wait, the problem says "the cats he is pointing to...". If we consider that this might be a different case.

Wait, but in this scenario:

- R=1 (end), adjacent to Bl=2

- Bk=5

So order: [R, Bl, G, W, Bk] or [R, Bl, W, G, Bk]

But the problem states "the cats he is pointing to... are colored red, blue, green, black, white respectively"—if this is not part of the solution but a statement in the problem, maybe we need to ignore it.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's recap:

Two cases from clue D (|Bl - Bk|=3):

Case 1: Bl=2, Bk=5

Then R must be at 1 or adjacent to Bl=2 → R=1 or 3

But R is on end (clue E), so R=1 (since position 3 isn't an end)

Thus order starts with R=1, Bl=2, then positions 3-4: G,W; Bk=5

Case 2: Bl=4, Bk=1

R must be at 5 (adjacent to Bl=4), so order ends with R=5

Positions 2-3: G,W

So two possible configurations.

Given that the problem asks "which cat is White", implying a unique answer, likely one of these cases has only one possibility for White.

Let's explore Case 1:

Order: [R, Bl, ?, ?, Bk]

With ? being G and W.

No further constraints (statements 2 and 3 don't help), so White could be in position 3 or 4.

Case 2:

Order: [Bk, ?, ?, Bl, R]

With ? = G, W

Again, two possibilities.

But wait, statement C: "Green is not green". If we interpret this as a clue that Green cannot be in the current position (but it's always green), or maybe it's a mistranslation of "Green is not White" or something. If it were "Green is not white", then we could use it.

Given the problem says "Green is not green", which is a lie, so if all statements are lies except one... Not sure.

Wait, another angle: In some contexts, especially in puzzles with "is next to" and such, you have to consider that the shop owner might be lying. If statement 3 is a paradox, it's a lie, so maybe the other statements are true?

Assume all statements except C are true:

- A: R adjacent to Bl

- B: Bk ≠ W (true)

- D: |Bl - Bk| = 3

- E: R on end

C is false.

In Case 1 above: [R, Bl, G, W, Bk]

Check if this works:

A: Yes

D: |2-5|=3, yes

E: R at 1, good

B: Black ≠ White (yes)

So this order satisfies all true statements. In this case, White is in position 4.

In Case 2: [Bk, G, W, Bl, R]

A: R(5) adjacent to Bl(4): yes

D: |4-1|=3: yes

E: R at end: yes

So here, White is in position 3.

But the problem states "the cats he is pointing to... are colored red, blue, green, black, and white respectively". If this means that the order is R,B,G,Bk,W, then our earlier check shows it doesn't satisfy statement D ("Blue is three over from Black" would be position 2 vs 4, difference of 2). So that can't be.

Given the problem's last sentence might be a mistranslation or misstatement, and assuming we have to go with logical deductions:

There are two possible orders. But maybe one of them violates an implicit constraint.

Wait, in Case 1: [R, Bl, G, W, Bk]

But Black is at position 5. The problem says "Black is not white"—which holds.

In Case 2: [Bk, ?, ?, Bl, R], White could be in 2 or 3.

Wait, but statement C ("Green is not green")—if it's a clue that the cat which is Green is not actually green (i.e., another color), but all cats have different colors... Not sure.

Alternatively, if "Green is not green" means that Green is not in position X, but since it's always true that Green is green, this statement being made might indicate that the speaker is lying about something else. I'm overcomplicating.

Let's see what happens if we choose Case 2 where Bk=1, Bl=4, R=5.

So positions:

1: Black

2: ?

3: ?

4: Blue

5: Red

Remaining colors Green and White for 2 and 3.

If the shop owner said "Green is not green", which is a lie, so maybe Green is actually white? No, all colors are distinct.

Wait, another idea: In some logic puzzles, such paradoxical statements can indicate that the color name is misleading. But here it's stated as "Green is not green"—so the cat colored green is not green (i.e., the cat is a different color). But no, the problem says "exotic cats which all have different colors" including green.

This seems like a dead end.

Given that in Case 2, White could be position 2 or 3, and in Case 1 White could be 4 or 3 (depending on order), but the problem expects one answer.

Wait, let's check online if this is a known puzzle. Wait, I can't do that, but recalling similar puzzles...

Ah! In some puzzles, "three over" means three positions to the right including itself? Not sure.

Wait, going back: If we take clue 4 as "Blue is three positions after Black", i.e., Blue = Black +3 (positions), then:

Black=1 → Blue=4

Black=2 → Blue=5

As before.

In Case 1: R=1, Bl=2, Bk=5

But wait, no—if Clue D is Blue three over from Black, meaning Blue's position = Black +3, then in this case Black would be at position x and Blue at x+3.

So if we have:

Case A: Black at 1 → Blue at 4

Case B: Black at 2 → Blue at 5

Let's re-examine with this strict interpretation.

First, Case A: Black=1, Blue=4

Clue E: Red is on end (position 1 or 5). Position 1 is Black, so Red=5

Clue A: Red (5) must be adjacent to Blue (4): Yes, good.

Remaining positions 2 and 3: Green and White.

So order: [Black, ?, ?, Blue, Red]

Now, what's the issue here? We have two possibilities for White. Unless another clue applies.

Statement C: "Green is not green". If we consider that in this puzzle context, saying "Green is not green" might be a mistranslation of "Green is not [next to] white" or something else, but with given info...

Wait, suppose that the statement "Green is not green" is supposed to mean "Green is not White", then it would be helpful. If it's a translation error from Chinese or another language.

Assuming that, then "Green is not white" → Green ≠ White, which we already know since all are different colors. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if the original statement was "Green is not black", but mistranslated.

Given the time I've spent, maybe the answer expected here is position 3 or 4.

Wait, in the problem's last sentence: If it's stating that the order is red, blue, green, black, white left to right, then White is fifth. But statements don't hold (as we saw). However, if this statement is part of the problem to be solved against, but the question is "which cat is White?" given the clues.

Wait, I think the key was that in the original problem's last sentence it says: "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." But this might actually be a misstatement of the solution. Maybe the puzzle is saying that after analyzing, the order is red, blue, etc., so White is last.

But given the statements contradict that order (e.g., statement 4 fails), I'm conflicted.

Wait, another approach: Let's assume all statements are true (which is contradictory for statement 3), so:

Statement 3: "Green is not green" must be interpreted as "The cat that is Green is not [in the position] green", but that's too vague.

Alternatively, it's a typo and should be "Green is next to White". If we assume that, then we can solve it.

Assume statement C is "Green is next to White".

Then with clues:

A. R adjacent Bl

B. Bk ≠ W (trivial)

C. G adjacent W

D. |Bl - Bk| =3

E. R at end

Let's try this.

Case 1: Black=1, Blue=4 (from clue D)

R must be at 5 (end), adjacent to Blue=4 ✔️

Remaining positions 2 and 3: G and W

Clue C: G next to W → they have to be in 2 and 3, which are adjacent. So yes.

Thus order: [Bk, G, W, Bl, R] or [Bk, W, G, Bl, R]

In this case, White is either position 2 or 3.

But with the assumption that statement C was mistranslated as "Green next to White", we still have two possibilities. Not unique.

Case 2: Black=2, Blue=5

R must be at end (1), adjacent to Blue? No (position 1 and 5 not adjacent). Invalid.

So only Case 1 works.

If the problem had statement C as "Green is next to White", then White could be position 3 or 2. Still two answers.

But given the original statement is "Green is not green", which is a lie, so if we assume that the shop owner lied on this one statement (all others true), then:

With statements A, B, D, E true; C false.

From before, in Case A: [Bk, G/W, W/G, Bl, R]

To determine White's position, need more info. Since there is none, but the problem expects an answer...

Wait, going back to the initial problem statement in Chinese maybe (as it mentions "exotic cats"), but I think we have to go with the most logical conclusion.

In Case A: Black=1, Blue=4, Red=5

Positions 2 and 3: Green and White

If there's no further clues, both are possible. But maybe in the original problem's context of "three over", there's an assumption that it's to the right or left.

Wait, another idea: If "Blue is three over from Black" means Blue comes three positions after Black when counting from left, i.e., Black at x, then next cat is x+1, etc., so Blue is third position after Black? No, "three over" likely means three positions away.

Given that I have to make a decision, and considering common puzzle conventions:

In many such puzzles with five elements, the solution often places White in the middle or specific spots. Given our two cases:

Case 1: [R, Bl, G/W, W/G, Bk] – no, earlier Case A was Black first.

Wait, let's fix the notation:

Let me define positions 1 (left) to 5 (right).

We had two valid configurations:

Configuration X:

1: Black

2: ?

3: ?

4: Blue

5: Red

Configuration Y:

1: Red

2: Blue

3: ?

4: ?

5: Black

But Configuration Y fails clue D because |Blue=2 - Black=5|=3, so it satisfies D. Wait, let's check.

Wait, in Configuration Y:

- R at 1 (end)

- Bl at 2 (adjacent to R: good)

- Bk at 5

|Bl (2) - Bk (5)| = 3 → satisfies clue D

Then remaining positions 3 and 4 are Green and White.

This configuration also works. So now we have two valid configurations:

X: [Black, ?, ?, Blue, Red]

Y: [Red, Blue, ?, ?, Black]

Wait, hold on! Earlier I missed that in Case B (Black=2, Blue=5), but no:

Wait, if clue D is interpreted as Blue = Black + 3 positions to the right.

Then:

If Black is at position x, Blue is at x+3

Possible only for x=1→4 or x=2→5

So two configurations:

Config A: Black=1, Blue=4

Config B: Black=2, Blue=5

For Config A:

- R must be on end (1 or 5). Position 1 is Black, so R=5

- R=5 adjacent to Bl=4 ✔️

- Remaining colors G, W at 2,3

Config B:

- R must be on end (1 or 5)

- Bl=5, so if R is to be adjacent to Bl, R would have to be at 4, but R must be on an end → contradiction. So Config B invalid.

Wait a minute! Here's the key.

In Configuration B: Black=2, Blue=5

Clue A requires Red to be adjacent to Blue (position 5), so Red would have to be in position 4. But clue E says Red is on the end (1 or 5). Position 4 isn't an end. Contradiction. Therefore Config B is invalid.

Thus only Configuration A is valid: Black=1, Blue=4, R=5

Remaining positions 2 and 3: Green and White.

Now, with no further clues, but the problem asks "which cat is White?", so there must be something we're missing.

Ah! Statement C: "Green is not green". If this statement is true (but it's a paradox), which would mean that Green does not exist, but all colors are present. Alternatively, if the shop owner says "Green is not green", meaning that in the arrangement, there is no cat colored Green? But no, problem states cats have different colors including green.

Wait, another thought: In some contexts, especially in older puzzles, saying a color isn't itself might indicate it's a trick. For example, if someone says "This cat is not blue", but here it's "Green is not green". The only way this makes sense is if the statement is false, hence Green is green (which it is), so maybe this clue is just there to confuse.

Given that we have two positions left for White, but the problem expects one answer, I think the issue might be with the interpretation of "three over".

Alternative interpretation: In some contexts, especially in terms of "over" as in exceeding or surpassing, "Blue is three over from Black" could mean that Blue has three more cats after it than Black? Not likely.

Wait, going back to basics. With only Configuration A valid:

Positions:

1: Black

2: ?

3: ?

4: Blue

5: Red

Colors left: Green and White for 2 and 3.

If we have to choose between these two, maybe the statement "Green is not green" implies that Green is White? No, colors are distinct.

Wait, unless in this puzzle's context, the paradoxical statement indicates that Green is a different color from what it seems. Not helpful.

Given all this, and considering that in many similar puzzles the middle position (3) is often used for a specific clue, I'll guess White is in position 3.

But why?

Wait, another angle: If "Green is not green" is a lie, then the truth is "Green is green", which doesn't help. But if we consider that the shop owner made all statements true except this one, and using that to infer something...

Alternatively, the problem might have swapped some statements.

Given time constraints, I think the answer expected here is White is in position 3 (third cat from left). So the order would be Black, Green, White, Blue, Red. But let's see:

Position 1: Black

2: Green

3: White

4: Blue

5: Red

Check clues:

A. R(5) next to Bl(4): yes

B. Bk ≠ W: yes

C. "Green is not green" – false, which aligns with it being a lie.

D. |Bl - Bk| = |4-1|=3 ✔️

E. R on end ✔️

This works. Similarly, if position 2=White:

Black, White, Green, Blue, Red

Also satisfies all clues (except C). So both are possible.

But the problem states "which cat is White?" implying a unique answer. There's inconsistency here.

Wait, looking back at the original problem statement: It says "the cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." If this sentence is asserting that the order IS red, blue, green, black, white (left to right), then White is fifth. But we saw that in this order:

- Statement 4: Blue (2) and Black (4): difference of 2, not 3. So statement 4 fails.

But the problem might be designed so that despite the contradictions, you have to say White is last. Given the wording "the cats he is pointing to... are colored...", it might be a direct statement of the order, making White fifth. Even though the statements don't hold, but the question says "so then, which cat is White?"—if the problem provides the order explicitly.

Wait, this could be the case. The sentence "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." might be the actual solution, so White is fifth.

But why include all those statements then? It would be a trick question where you have to ignore the statements because they're given in the problem's description.

Yes, this must be it. The problem says: After stating the five strange things he said, it describes that "the cats he is pointing to... are colored red, blue, green, black, white respectively". So despite the confusing statements (which might be lies or nonsense), the actual order is R,B,G,Bk,W.

Therefore, White is fifth.

But the question says: "So, then, which cat is White?" So the answer is the last one, White.

Given that the problem explicitly states the order in that sentence, I think this is the case. The statements are probably red herrings or something to confuse, but the actual order is given.

Wait, no—if it's a logic puzzle, usually you have to deduce the order from clues. But if the problem directly says "the cats... are colored...", then it's stating the solution. Maybe translation issue: In Chinese, sometimes the structure can be confusing.

Given all this confusion, and considering that the last sentence explicitly lists the colors left to right as red, blue, green, black, white, the answer is White is fifth (position 5). So the cat that is White is the one on the far right.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{White}
Wait, no—the question says "which cat is White", meaning which color's position? Wait, no: The cats have colors red, blue, etc. The answer should be the position or the color name?

Wait, original problem: "So, then, which cat is White?"

Probably asking for the position (e.g., third from left), but in Chinese puzzles sometimes it's described as "the white cat is...". Given the problem states the order is red, blue, green, black, white from left to right, so White is fifth.

But the way the question is phrased: "which cat is White?" likely expects an answer like "fifth" or "last", but since it's a box, probably \boxed{White} is not correct. Wait, no—wait.

Wait, in the problem statement: The cats have different colors: red, blue, green, black, white. The question is asking which cat (i.e., what color?) is White—but that doesn't make sense. No—it's a bit confusingly phrased.

Actually, re-reading: "the cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So each cat has the respective color in order. Then "which cat is White?" would be the last one (fifth position). But the answer format should be boxed.

In many such puzzles, you specify the position. But given the problem's exact wording...

Wait, I think the key realization is that the problem statement itself gives the order: red, blue, green, black, white from left to right. So White is the fifth cat. Therefore, the answer is the last one.

But since the question says "which cat is White", and all cats are named by color, it's a bit odd. Maybe in Chinese, the phrasing implies "in which position is the white cat", but translated as "which cat".

Given the problem explicitly states that the order is red, blue, green, black, white, so White is fifth.

But I'm supposed to put \boxed{White}? Or \boxed{5}?

The original problem says: "the cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So if you point to each cat in order, they are red, then blue, etc. So the White cat is the last one.

But the question is "which cat is White?"—it's a bit odd because it's asking about the cat that is White, which would be "the white cat", but the answer expected is probably its position.

However, given the problem says "So, then, which cat is White?", and the context of similar puzzles where you have to state the color or position... Given the initial confusion, I think due to the explicit statement in the problem that the order is red, blue, green, black, white left to right, the answer is that White is the last one.

But since the user instruction says "which cat is White", and cats are referred to by their colors, it's a bit confusing. In standard terms for such puzzles, you specify the position number.

Wait, looking back at my detailed analysis earlier, if we take the problem's last sentence as stating the actual order (despite seeming contradictory with statements), then:

Left to right: Red, Blue, Green, Black, White

Hence, White is fifth.

Given that the problem says "the cats he is pointing to... are colored red...", this is likely the answer they want, making White the last cat.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5}

# Answer

The problem presents a scenario where a shop owner points to five exotic cats with different colors—red, blue, green, black, and white—and makes several seemingly strange statements about their arrangement. The key to solving this puzzle lies in interpreting the **final sentence** of the problem:

> "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively."

This sentence **explicitly states** the order of the cats:  
1. Red  
2. Blue  
3. Green  
4. Black  
5. White  

This is a **critical clue**, not a riddle or a misleading statement. In logic puzzles like this, such an explicit description often serves as the solution rather than being part of the puzzle itself—especially when it's directly given and matches the expected format (i.e., five distinct colors in order from left to right).

---

### Why This Is the Solution

Let’s verify that this order is consistent with the statements made by the shop owner:

1. **"Red is next to Blue."**  
   - Red is at position 1, Blue at 2 → ✅ Adjacent

2. **"Black is not white."**  
   - Black is at position 4, White at 5 → ✅ Different colors

3. **"Green is not green."**  
   - This is a contradiction (a paradox), and in this context, it serves as a red herring or a misstatement meant to confuse the solver.

4. **"Blue is three over from Black."**  
   - Blue at position 2, Black at position 4 → Distance = 2 positions apart (not 3). However, if we interpret "three over" loosely (e.g., in some puzzle contexts), it could be a trick or misstatement.

5. **"Red is on the end."**  
   - Red is at position 1 → ✅ On the left end

While statement #4 appears to contradict the order (as the distance between Blue and Black is only two positions, not three), this may reflect the shop owner’s unusual phrasing or a deliberate trick in the problem's wording.

Importantly, **the final sentence explicitly states** that the cats are colored *in that specific order*: red → blue → green → black → white.

---

### Interpreting the Question

The question asks:  
> "So, then, which cat is White?"

Given the explicit description in the problem — that the cats from left to right are **red, blue, green, black, and white** — it follows that:

- The **white cat** is the **fifth one**, or **last**.

In many logic puzzles like this, especially when the order is directly given, the expected answer is typically the **position** of a specific color (e.g., "which position is White?").
