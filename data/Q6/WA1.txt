We need to parse puzzle. The statements are about positions relative? Given list left to right: red, blue, green, black, white. Which cat is white? They ask which cat is white? But we already know order; maybe they mean which position? White is at position 5. So answer: the fifth cat. Let's respond.

[Answer]
The statement “White” refers to the fifth (right‑most) cat in the lineup. In other words, the white cat is the one at the far right end of the row.
