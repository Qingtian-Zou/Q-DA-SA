[Question]
A shop owner points to each of her exotic cats, which all have different colors, and says something strange:

"Red is next to Blue."
"Black is not white."
"Green is not green."
"Blue is three over from Black."
"Red is on the end."

The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively.

So, then, which cat is White?
