We have a riddle: shop owner points to each exotic cat with different colors. They say statements about colors positions: "Red is next to Blue." etc. Cats left to right are red, blue, green, black, white. Then ask: which cat is White? That seems trivial: the last one in order is white. But maybe trick: the owner says "White" but we need identify cat that is White? Actually the question: "So, then, which cat is White?" Might be a trick: answer could be "the fifth cat" or "the cat at the rightmost position". But maybe the puzzle expects to determine color of each cat based on statements. The given order matches constraints? Let's test.

Positions 1-5 left to right: red(1), blue(2), green(3), black(4), white(5). Check statements:

"Red is next to Blue." Yes, red pos1 adjacent to blue pos2.

"Black is not white." Black at pos4; not white yes.

"Green is not green." Green at pos3; this statement says green is not green? That seems contradictory. Maybe the phrase means "Green cat is not next to green"? But no. Perhaps it's a trick: the statement is false. The shop owner may say something strange, maybe he lies or some are true/false. The question: which cat is White? Might require logical deduction that white cat is at pos5. But why mention all these statements? Maybe the statements are clues to find order of colors; but they've already given the order. So maybe they want to ask "Which cat is White?" answer: The fifth cat.

However, maybe there's a twist: The shop owner points to each cat and says those statements. We have to interpret them as spoken by the cat? Or maybe it's about positions relative to each other: "Blue is three over from Black." Means blue is 3 positions after black? But in given order, blue pos2, black pos4; difference -2. Not 3. So maybe our interpretation wrong.

Let's parse statements:

"Red is next to Blue." So red adjacent to blue.

"Black is not white." obviously true if colors distinct.

"Green is not green." Could be that the cat named Green is not colored green? But they said each cat has different colors, but could have names like "Green"? Might be a trick: The statement "Green is not green" means the cat called Green (by name) is not color green. So maybe there is a cat named Green who isn't green. That might mean there's a cat named 'Green' which has some other color.

"Blue is three over from Black." Means blue's position relative to black: maybe blue is 3 positions ahead of black, i.e., blue is to the right of black by 3? In list, if black pos4, then 3 over would be pos7 (nonexistent). So not. Maybe it's a puzzle where you have to figure out arrangement.

"Red is on the end." Means red at one of ends.

Given constraints, we can solve for positions. Let's treat colors: R,Bg,Gk? Wait there are five distinct colors: red, blue, green, black, white. We need assign them to 5 positions left to right such that statements hold. Additionally maybe some statements could be false; but the shop owner says "something strange" indicates maybe some statements may not all be true.

But the puzzle statement says: "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So they already gave the arrangement. Then ask which cat is White? That's trivial: the last one. But maybe it's a trick question where answer is something else.

Wait: The riddle might be about wordplay: "Which cat is White?" Could refer to cat that says 'white' or 'White cat' as a name, not color. Maybe each cat has a name equal to its color? They say statements like "Green is not green." That could mean the cat named Green does not have color green; thus his name is not matching his color.

But we are asked which cat is White. Maybe there is a cat named White who might not be colored white. So answer: The cat whose name is White is not actually white. But from order, we know last cat's color is white, but maybe the cat named White could be at some other position. We don't have names except colors. But the statement "Green is not green" suggests that cat named Green has a different color. So maybe each cat has a name that is one of these colors, but the actual color might differ for some. The statements refer to name and color relationships.

Thus we need to find mapping between names (R,B,Gk,Bt,W?) Wait.

Let's denote cats: there are five cats with distinct names? Actually they say "shop owner points to each of her exotic cats, which all have different colors, and says something strange:" The statements talk about colors but maybe refer to the cat named that color. So we have 5 cats each named after a color? But they also have distinct colors; but some may not match names.

Thus we need to determine which cat (by name) is white? i.e., which cat's name is White? That would be trivial: the cat whose name is 'White', but maybe that's just one of them. But if we know positions, we can identify that cat by position.

Given order left to right colors: red, blue, green, black, white. So the last cat has color white. Its name might not be white; could be something else. The statements: "Black is not white." That refers to cat named Black? Actually statement uses color words but ambiguous. If it's about names, "Black is not white" means cat named Black does not have color white. So we need mapping of name to color.

We know colors are distinct; so each cat has a unique color. Names maybe also colors but could mismatch.

Let's set up: Let cats be positions 1-5 with colors as given: pos1=red, pos2=blue, pos3=green, pos4=black, pos5=white. Now assign names to these cats; names are one of the colors {red, blue, green, black, white}. We need a permutation such that statements hold:

Statements interpret as:

"Red is next to Blue." Means cat named Red is adjacent to cat named Blue (positions difference 1).
"Black is not white." Means cat named Black does NOT have color white. So the cat with name Black cannot be at pos5.
"Green is not green." Means cat named Green does NOT have color green. So cat named Green cannot be at pos3.
"Blue is three over from Black." Means cat named Blue is 3 positions away from cat named Black (difference 3). Might be left or right? Likely absolute difference =3.
"Red is on the end." Means cat named Red is at either position1 or position5.
We need to find a mapping that satisfies all.

Let's brute think. Positions with colors: [R,Bg,Gk,Bt,W]. We'll assign names: a permutation of {red, blue, green, black, white}. Let's denote N_i = name at pos i. Constraints:

C1: |pos(N_red) - pos(N_blue)| = 1
C2: N_black cannot be at pos5 (since that would have color white)
C3: N_green cannot be at pos3
C4: |pos(N_blue)-pos(N_black)| =3
C5: pos(N_red)=1 or 5

Also all positions distinct.

Let's search manually. Since difference between blue and black is 3, possibilities: if pos(blue) =1 then pos(black)=4; if pos(blue)=2 then pos(black)=5; if pos(blue)=3 then pos(black)=6 (invalid); if pos(blue)=4 then pos(black)=1; if pos(blue)=5 then pos(black)=2.

But N_black cannot be at pos5, so exclude cases where black=5. So possible pairs:

blue at 1 => black at 4
blue at 2 => black at 5 (invalid)
blue at 4 => black at 1
blue at 5 => black at 2
So remaining possibilities: (blue,black) = (1,4), (4,1), or (5,2). But black cannot be at 5; that's fine.

Now red is adjacent to blue. So positions of red must be next to blue's position. Also red at end 1 or 5.

Case A: blue=1. Then red must be adjacent: only pos2. But red also must be at end (pos1 or 5). Conflict. So case invalid.

Case B: blue=4, black=1. Then red adjacent to blue (pos3 or 5). Also red at end (1 or 5). Can't be 1 because occupied by black; so red must be pos5. That works: red at pos5. Check adjacency: pos5 adjacent to pos4? Yes. So fine.

Now check other constraints: N_black not white: black name at pos1 color is red. That's okay (not white). N_green not green: we haven't assigned green yet; cannot be pos3 because that's green color but could have name green? Wait constraint says cat named Green cannot have color green, meaning the cat whose name is 'green' cannot occupy the position with color green (pos3). So we need to ensure that the name 'green' is not at pos3. We haven't assigned yet.

We currently have positions:

1: color red; name black
2: color blue; name ?
3: color green; name ?
4: color black; name blue? Wait we set blue name at pos4? Actually no, name 'blue' is at pos4 because blue=4. So pos4 has name blue and color black.
5: color white; name red

Remaining names to assign to positions 2 and 3 are {green, white}. We must avoid placing green at pos3. So place green at pos2 and white at pos3.

Check constraints: N_black not white satisfied (pos1 is red). N_green not green satisfied (name green at pos2 color blue). Good.

All constraints satisfied! So mapping found.

Thus the cat named White is at position 3, which has color green. But question: "So, then, which cat is White?" Might ask which cat is named White? According to our solution, name 'White' is at position 3, with color green. But we might interpret differently: Which cat (by position) is white colored? That would be position5. However puzzle seems about naming.

Thus answer likely "The third cat from the left" or "the one in the middle." Let's phrase: The cat named White is the one in the middle (third from left). So answer: the green-colored cat, which is the third one. But they may ask "which cat is White?" meaning which cat's color is white? That would be last cat.

Let's read puzzle statement again: "The cats he is pointing to, from left to right, are colored red, blue, green, black, and white, respectively." So they already said the colors of each cat. Then ask "So, then, which cat is White?" That seems trivial given that list; maybe trick is that 'White' might be a name not color. But they say cats are colored ... respectively. So last cat is white. But maybe they want the answer: "the cat at the far right" or "the fifth cat." Could be too easy.

But maybe it's a trick about wordplay: The statements refer to colors but also names; and we deduced that the cat named White is actually green colored. So which cat is White? The cat named White, not color white. But the puzzle didn't mention names earlier except in statements. They asked "which cat is White?" ambiguous.

Thus answer: the third cat from the left (the one with green color). I'll give explanation.

Let's craft final answer.

[Answer]
The key is that the five “color‑words” are being used as names for the cats, not just to describe their coats.

So each cat has a name that happens to be one of the five colours (red, blue, green, black, white) and it also has a coat colour – all five different.

From the clues we can reconstruct which name sits on which coloured cat:

Position	Coat colour	Cat’s name
1	        red	        black
2	    blue        	green
3	    green       	white
4	    black	        blue
5	    white       	red
(Everything satisfies the five statements:

Red (cat) is next to Blue (cat).
Black (cat) isn’t the white cat.
Green (cat) isn’t the green‑coated cat.
Blue (cat) is three places from Black (cat).
Red (cat) is at an end.)

Thus, the cat that is named “White” is the one in the middle – the third cat from the left, whose coat colour is green.
