# Q-DA-SA
Question, dumb answer by (vision) language model and smart answer.

Many questions have more than one way to answer, but some models seem to solve them in a dumb way, wasting computing resources. For example, the brute force method is valid. However, what if there are clues that point to cases of higher possibility? This repository hopes to document those questions, dumb answers, and smart answers (and wrong answers, if any). Who knows? Maybe it can spark some data set for a "smart" model.
