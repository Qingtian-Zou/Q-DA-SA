# Q-DA-SA
Question, dumb answer (by LLM) and smart answer.

Many questions have more than one way to answer, but some current LLMs seem to solve them in a dumb way, wasting computing resources. This repository hopes to document those questions, dumb answers and smart answers (and wrong answers, if any). Who knows? Maybe it can spark some data set for a "smart" LLM.
